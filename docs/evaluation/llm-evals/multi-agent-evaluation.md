# Multi-Agent System Evaluation

Multi-agent systems present unique evaluation challenges that go beyond single-agent evaluation. This guide covers the key architectures, evaluation strategies, and additional considerations for effectively evaluating multi-agent systems.

## Multi-Agent System Architectures

Multi-agent systems can be organized in several different architectural patterns, each requiring specific evaluation approaches:

### Hierarchical Architecture

In hierarchical architectures, agents are organized in a tree-like structure with clear parent-child relationships:

- **Manager-Agent Pattern**: A central manager agent coordinates and delegates tasks to specialized worker agents
- **Supervisor-Subordinate Pattern**: Higher-level agents supervise and validate the work of lower-level agents

**Evaluation Considerations:**
- Evaluate the manager's delegation decisions
- Assess coordination efficiency between levels
- Measure the quality of task distribution

### Sequential Architecture

In sequential architectures, agents process tasks in a defined order, with each agent building on the previous one's output:

- **Pipeline Pattern**: Each agent handles a specific stage of processing
- **Chain-of-Thought Pattern**: Agents progressively refine and build upon each other's reasoning

**Evaluation Considerations:**
- Evaluate the quality of handoffs between agents
- Assess whether each agent adds value to the process
- Measure end-to-end latency and efficiency

### Parallel Architecture

In parallel architectures, multiple agents work simultaneously on different aspects of a task:

- **Competitive Pattern**: Multiple agents work on the same problem, with the best solution selected
- **Collaborative Pattern**: Agents work on different sub-tasks that are later combined

**Evaluation Considerations:**
- Evaluate the coordination and conflict resolution mechanisms
- Assess the quality of solution selection or combination
- Measure resource utilization and efficiency

### Hybrid Architectures

Many real-world systems combine multiple architectural patterns:

- **Hierarchical + Parallel**: Manager agents coordinate parallel worker agents
- **Sequential + Hierarchical**: Sequential processing with hierarchical decision-making at each stage

**Evaluation Considerations:**
- Evaluate each architectural component separately
- Assess the integration points between different patterns
- Measure overall system coherence and performance

## Evaluation Strategies for Multi-Agent Systems

### 1. Agent Handoff Evaluation

Agent handoffs are essentially tool calling evaluations. When one agent passes control to another, you can evaluate:

- **Handoff Appropriateness**: Did the first agent correctly identify when to hand off?
- **Information Transfer**: Was all necessary context passed to the next agent?
- **Handoff Timing**: Was the handoff made at the optimal point in the process?

```python
# Example: Evaluating agent handoff quality
def evaluate_handoff_quality(input_data, handoff_decision, next_agent_output):
    """
    Evaluate whether an agent handoff was appropriate and effective.
    
    Args:
        input_data: Original user input
        handoff_decision: The decision to hand off and what was passed
        next_agent_output: Output from the receiving agent
    
    Returns:
        Evaluation score and explanation
    """
    # Use existing tool calling evaluation logic
    # The handoff can be treated as a "tool call" to another agent
    pass
```

### 2. System-Level Evaluation

Beyond individual agent performance, evaluate the system as a whole:

- **End-to-End Task Completion**: Did the system successfully complete the user's request?
- **System Efficiency**: How many agent interactions were required?
- **User Experience**: Was the interaction smooth and coherent?

### 3. Coordination Evaluation

Assess how well agents work together:

- **Communication Quality**: Are agents effectively sharing information?
- **Conflict Resolution**: How well are disagreements or conflicts handled?
- **Resource Sharing**: Are agents efficiently sharing and utilizing resources?

## Additional Considerations for Multi-Agent Evaluation

### 1. Complexity Management

Multi-agent systems introduce additional complexity that must be managed:

- **Trace Complexity**: Multi-agent traces can be much more complex than single-agent traces
- **Evaluation Scope**: You may need to evaluate at multiple levels (individual agents, pairs, and system-wide)
- **Data Volume**: Multi-agent systems generate significantly more data to evaluate

### 2. Emergent Behaviors

Multi-agent systems can exhibit emergent behaviors that don't exist in single-agent systems:

- **Collective Intelligence**: The system may perform better than any individual agent
- **Unintended Interactions**: Agents may interact in unexpected ways
- **System Dynamics**: The overall system behavior may be non-linear

### 3. Evaluation Granularity

Choose the right level of granularity for your evaluation:

- **Agent-Level**: Evaluate each agent's individual performance
- **Interaction-Level**: Evaluate the quality of agent-to-agent interactions
- **System-Level**: Evaluate the overall system performance
- **User-Level**: Evaluate the end-user experience

### 4. Performance Metrics

Consider these additional metrics for multi-agent systems:

- **Latency**: Total time from user input to final response
- **Throughput**: Number of requests the system can handle
- **Scalability**: How performance changes with the number of agents
- **Reliability**: System stability and error handling
- **Cost**: Computational and financial costs of running multiple agents

## Practical Evaluation Approaches

### 1. Leverage Existing Single-Agent Evaluations

Many multi-agent evaluation challenges can be addressed using existing single-agent evaluation techniques:

- **Tool Calling Evaluations**: Use for agent handoffs and delegation decisions
- **Path Convergence**: Evaluate whether the system converges to optimal solutions
- **Planning Evaluations**: Assess the quality of multi-agent planning and coordination

### 2. Create Multi-Agent Specific Evaluations

Develop evaluations specifically for multi-agent scenarios:

- **Coordination Quality**: Evaluate how well agents work together
- **System Efficiency**: Measure the efficiency of the overall system
- **Emergent Behavior Detection**: Identify and evaluate unexpected system behaviors

### 3. Use Hierarchical Evaluation

Structure your evaluation to match the system architecture:

- **Bottom-Up**: Start with individual agent evaluation, then build up to system evaluation
- **Top-Down**: Start with system-level goals, then break down to agent-level requirements
- **Hybrid**: Combine both approaches for comprehensive evaluation

## Example: Evaluating a Customer Support Multi-Agent System

Consider a customer support system with three agents:
1. **Router Agent**: Determines the type of issue and routes to appropriate specialist
2. **Technical Agent**: Handles technical problems
3. **Billing Agent**: Handles billing and account issues

### Evaluation Strategy:

1. **Individual Agent Evaluation**:
   - Router accuracy in classifying issues
   - Technical agent's problem-solving ability
   - Billing agent's accuracy in resolving billing issues

2. **Handoff Evaluation**:
   - Router's decision to hand off vs. handle directly
   - Quality of information passed between agents
   - Smoothness of transitions

3. **System-Level Evaluation**:
   - Overall customer satisfaction
   - Time to resolution
   - First-call resolution rate

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic evaluations and gradually add complexity
2. **Focus on User Experience**: Ultimately, the user experience is what matters most
3. **Monitor System Dynamics**: Watch for emergent behaviors and system-level issues
4. **Iterate and Refine**: Continuously improve your evaluation approach based on results
5. **Document Everything**: Multi-agent systems are complex; thorough documentation is essential
