# Crate a prompt

Navigate to the **Prompts** in the navigation and click the add prompt button on the top right. This will navigate you to the Playground.&#x20;

## Compose a prompt

The playground is like the IDE where you will develop your prompt. The prompt section on the right lets you add more messages, change the template format (f-string or mustache), and an output schema (JSON mode).

To the right you can enter sample inputs for your prompt variables and run your prompt against a model. Make sure that you have an API key set for the LLM provider of your choosing.



## Save the prompt

To save the prompt, click the save button in the header of the prompt on the right. Name the prompt using alpha numeric characters (e.x. \`my-first-prompt\`) with no spaces. \
\
The model configuration you selected in the Playground will be saved with the prompt. When you re-open the prompt, the model and configuration will be loaded along with the prompt.



## Manage your prompts

You just created your first prompt in Phoenix! You can view and search for prompts by navigating to Prompts in the UI.
