# Test a prompt

### Testing a prompt in the playground

The playground is a great way to quickly iterate on prompt variations. You can load in prompts you previously had been working on and validate that a prompt works across various examples in a dataset so that you can build sufficient confidence that your prompt is ready for your application.

#### Testing prompt variations side-by-side

Prompt Playground supports testing multiple prompt variants side-by-side. Use the `+ Compare` button to add a prompt variant. Whether you're using Span Replay or running your prompts over a Dataset, playground will run your inputs through each prompt variant and show the results side-by-side.

## Testing a prompt using code

Sometimes you may want to test a prompt and run evaluations on a given prompt. This can be particularly useful when custom manipulation is needed (e.x. you are trying to iterate on a system prompt on a variaety of different chat messages).
