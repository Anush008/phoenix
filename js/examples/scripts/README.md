# Scripts

A collection of example scripts demonstrating usage of `@arizeai/phoenix-evals` and `@arizeai/phoenix-client`

## Usage

To use the scripts, install the dependencies of this package and then run:

```shell
pnpm install
pnpm start -- "<script-path>"
```

For example:

```shell
pnpm start -- src/evals/experiment_evaluation_example.ts
```

Most script assume they are running in an environment with access to an `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable,
as well as a local phoenix instance, with authentication disabled, running at `http://localhost:6006`.

You are free to modify and experiment with any examples as you see fit, enjoy!
