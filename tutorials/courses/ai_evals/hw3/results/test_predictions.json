The use of unsweetened almond milk helps keep the carbohydrate content low. Chia seeds are high in fiber and omega-3 fatty acids, which can help manage blood sugar levels. The recipe does include an optional addition of honey or maple syrup for sweetness, but since this is optional, it allows individuals to omit it to better control sugar intake.

This will toast the rice and help it absorb flavor.\n\n5. **Add the Broth Gradually:** Start adding the warm broth, one ladleful at a time, to the rice. Stir constantly and allow the rice to absorb the liquid before adding more. This process will take about 18-20 minutes. The risotto is done when the rice is creamy and al dente, with a slight bite left to it.\n\n6. **Finish with Cheese and Seasoning:** Once the rice is cooked to your desired consistency, remove it from the heat. If you\u2019re using Parmesan cheese, stir it in at this point for extra creaminess. Taste and adjust seasoning with more salt and pepper as needed.\n\n7. **Serve:** Spoon the risotto into bowls and top with the reserved saut\u00e9ed mushrooms. Garnish with freshly chopped parsley for a pop of color.

It's rich in flavor yet made with wholesome ingredients. This recipe serves 2 people.\n\n### Creamy Mushroom Risotto\n\n**Ingredients:**\n- 1 cup Arborio rice\n- 2 cups low-sodium vegetable broth (or chicken broth)\n- 1 cup mushrooms, sliced (such as cremini or button)\n- 1 small onion, finely chopped\n- 2 cloves garlic, minced\n- 1 tablespoon olive oil\n- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter\n- 1\/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese (optional)\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Prepare the Broth:** In a small saucepan, heat the vegetable or chicken broth over low heat and let it simmer. Keeping the broth warm will help the rice cook evenly.\n\n2. **Saut\u00e9 the Aromatics:** In a medium-sized heavy-bottomed pot, heat the olive oil and butter over medium heat. Once the butter has melted, add the chopped onion. Saut\u00e9 for about 3-4 minutes, or until the onion becomes translucent. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.\n\n3. **Cook the Mushrooms:** Toss in the sliced mushrooms and cook until they release their moisture and begin to brown, about 5-7 minutes. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper to enhance the flavor. Remove half of the mushrooms and set aside for garnish later.\n\n4. **Toast the Rice:** Add the Arborio rice to the pot and stir it constantly for about 2-3 minutes. This will toast the rice and help it absorb flavor.\n\n5. **Add the Broth Gradually:** Start adding the warm broth, one ladleful at a time, to the rice. Stir constantly and allow the rice to absorb the liquid before adding more. This process will take about 18-20 minutes. The risotto is done when the rice is creamy and al dente, with a slight bite left to it.\n\n6. **Finish with Cheese and Seasoning:** Once the rice is cooked to your desired consistency, remove it from the heat. If you\u2019re using Parmesan cheese, stir it in at this point for extra creaminess. Taste and adjust seasoning with more salt and pepper as needed.\n\n7. **Serve:** Spoon the risotto into bowls and top with the reserved saut\u00e9ed mushrooms.

Additionally, the recipe uses Parmesan cheese, which is optional, but the presence of rice as the main ingredient is the primary concern. While the recipe uses low-sodium broth and unsalted butter, which are positive choices for reducing sodium and saturated fat, the carbohydrate content from the rice is significant and could impact blood sugar levels.

In a medium saucepan, combine the rinsed quinoa and vegetable broth (or water). Bring it to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to low. Cover and simmer for about 15 minutes, or until the quinoa is fluffy and the liquid is absorbed. Once cooked, fluff it with a fork and set aside.\n\n3. **Roast the Vegetables:**\n   On a large baking sheet, toss the diced zucchini, bell pepper, carrot, and red onion with olive oil, salt, pepper, and dried oregano. Spread the vegetables out in a single layer. Roast in the preheated oven for about 20 minutes, stirring halfway through, until they are tender and slightly caramelized.\n\n4. **Combine Ingredients:**\n   In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooked quinoa and roasted vegetables. Drizzle with fresh lemon juice to add brightness and stir gently to mix everything together. Taste and adjust salt and pepper as needed.\n\n5. **Serve:**\n   Divide the quinoa salad between two bowls or plates.

It's rich in flavor yet made with wholesome ingredients. This recipe serves 2 people.\n\n### Creamy Mushroom Risotto\n\n**Ingredients:**\n- 1 cup Arborio rice\n- 2 cups low-sodium vegetable broth (or chicken broth)\n- 1 cup mushrooms, sliced (such as cremini or button)\n- 1 small onion, finely chopped\n- 2 cloves garlic, minced\n- 1 tablespoon olive oil\n- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter\n- 1\/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese (optional)\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Prepare the Broth:** In a small saucepan, heat the vegetable or chicken broth over low heat and let it simmer. Keeping the broth warm will help the rice cook evenly.\n\n2. **Saut\u00e9 the Aromatics:** In a medium-sized heavy-bottomed pot, heat the olive oil and butter over medium heat. Once the butter has melted, add the chopped onion. Saut\u00e9 for about 3-4 minutes, or until the onion becomes translucent. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.\n\n3. **Cook the Mushrooms:** Toss in the sliced mushrooms and cook until they release their moisture and begin to brown, about 5-7 minutes. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper to enhance the flavor. Remove half of the mushrooms and set aside for garnish later.\n\n4. **Toast the Rice:** Add the Arborio rice to the pot and stir it constantly for about 2-3 minutes. This will toast the rice and help it absorb flavor.\n\n5. **Add the Broth Gradually:** Start adding the warm broth, one ladleful at a time, to the rice. Stir constantly and allow the rice to absorb the liquid before adding more. This process will take about 18-20 minutes. The risotto is done when the rice is creamy and al dente, with a slight bite left to it.\n\n6. **Finish with Cheese and Seasoning:** Once the rice is cooked to your desired consistency, remove it from the heat. If you\u2019re using Parmesan cheese, stir it in at this point for extra creaminess. Taste and adjust seasoning with more salt and pepper as needed.\n\n7. **Serve:** Spoon the risotto into bowls and top with the reserved saut\u00e9ed mushrooms.

Use a spatula to scrape down the sides as needed to ensure everything is well incorporated. \n\n4. **Adjust Consistency and Flavor:** Check the consistency; you want it to be creamy and spreadable but not too runny. If needed, add more water one tablespoon at a time until you achieve your desired consistency. Taste and adjust seasoning \u2013 feel free to add more lemon juice or salt, depending on your preference.\n\n5. **Add Fresh Herbs (Optional):** If you\u2019d like a herby kick, add some chopped fresh herbs, like basil or chives, to the blender and pulse a few times until combined.\n\n6. **Serve and Store:** Transfer the cashew cheese to a bowl and serve immediately or chill it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes to firm up slightly. This cheese pairs wonderfully with crackers, fresh veggies, or as a spread on sandwiches.\n\n7. **Storage:** Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week.

It's rich in flavor yet made with wholesome ingredients. This recipe serves 2 people.\n\n### Creamy Mushroom Risotto\n\n**Ingredients:**\n- 1 cup Arborio rice\n- 2 cups low-sodium vegetable broth (or chicken broth)\n- 1 cup mushrooms, sliced (such as cremini or button)\n- 1 small onion, finely chopped\n- 2 cloves garlic, minced\n- 1 tablespoon olive oil\n- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter\n- 1\/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese (optional)\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Prepare the Broth:** In a small saucepan, heat the vegetable or chicken broth over low heat and let it simmer. Keeping the broth warm will help the rice cook evenly.\n\n2. **Saut\u00e9 the Aromatics:** In a medium-sized heavy-bottomed pot, heat the olive oil and butter over medium heat. Once the butter has melted, add the chopped onion. Saut\u00e9 for about 3-4 minutes, or until the onion becomes translucent. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.\n\n3. **Cook the Mushrooms:** Toss in the sliced mushrooms and cook until they release their moisture and begin to brown, about 5-7 minutes. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper to enhance the flavor. Remove half of the mushrooms and set aside for garnish later.\n\n4. **Toast the Rice:** Add the Arborio rice to the pot and stir it constantly for about 2-3 minutes. This will toast the rice and help it absorb flavor.\n\n5. **Add the Broth Gradually:** Start adding the warm broth, one ladleful at a time, to the rice. Stir constantly and allow the rice to absorb the liquid before adding more. This process will take about 18-20 minutes. The risotto is done when the rice is creamy and al dente, with a slight bite left to it.\n\n6. **Finish with Cheese and Seasoning:** Once the rice is cooked to your desired consistency, remove it from the heat. If you\u2019re using Parmesan cheese, stir it in at this point for extra creaminess. Taste and adjust seasoning with more salt and pepper as needed.\n\n7. **Serve:** Spoon the risotto into bowls and top with the reserved saut\u00e9ed mushrooms.

It's rich in flavor yet made with wholesome ingredients. This recipe serves 2 people.\n\n### Creamy Mushroom Risotto\n\n**Ingredients:**\n- 1 cup Arborio rice\n- 2 cups low-sodium vegetable broth (or chicken broth)\n- 1 cup mushrooms, sliced (such as cremini or button)\n- 1 small onion, finely chopped\n- 2 cloves garlic, minced\n- 1 tablespoon olive oil\n- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter\n- 1\/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese (optional)\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Prepare the Broth:** In a small saucepan, heat the vegetable or chicken broth over low heat and let it simmer. Keeping the broth warm will help the rice cook evenly.\n\n2. **Saut\u00e9 the Aromatics:** In a medium-sized heavy-bottomed pot, heat the olive oil and butter over medium heat. Once the butter has melted, add the chopped onion. Saut\u00e9 for about 3-4 minutes, or until the onion becomes translucent. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.\n\n3. **Cook the Mushrooms:** Toss in the sliced mushrooms and cook until they release their moisture and begin to brown, about 5-7 minutes. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper to enhance the flavor. Remove half of the mushrooms and set aside for garnish later.\n\n4. **Toast the Rice:** Add the Arborio rice to the pot and stir it constantly for about 2-3 minutes. This will toast the rice and help it absorb flavor.\n\n5. **Add the Broth Gradually:** Start adding the warm broth, one ladleful at a time, to the rice. Stir constantly and allow the rice to absorb the liquid before adding more. This process will take about 18-20 minutes. The risotto is done when the rice is creamy and al dente, with a slight bite left to it.\n\n6. **Finish with Cheese and Seasoning:** Once the rice is cooked to your desired consistency, remove it from the heat. If you\u2019re using Parmesan cheese, stir it in at this point for extra creaminess. Taste and adjust seasoning with more salt and pepper as needed.\n\n7. **Serve:** Spoon the risotto into bowls and top with the reserved saut\u00e9ed mushrooms. Garnish with freshly chopped parsley for a pop of color.

This recipe yields enough dough for two medium pizzas, serving about 2 people.\n\n### Gluten-Free Pizza Dough Recipe\n\n#### Ingredients:\n- 1 \u00bd cups gluten-free all-purpose flour (look for one that contains xanthan gum)\n- 1 teaspoon baking powder\n- \u00bd teaspoon salt\n- 1 teaspoon garlic powder (optional for flavor)\n- \u00be cup warm water (about 110\u00b0F or 43\u00b0C)\n- 2 tablespoons olive oil\n- 1 teaspoon honey or sugar (to help with browning)\n- 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar\n\n#### Instructions:\n\n1. **Prepare the Dry Ingredients**: In a medium mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free all-purpose flour, baking powder, salt, and garlic powder (if using). Whisk these dry ingredients together until they are well blended and there are no lumps.\n\n2. **Mix the Wet Ingredients**: In a separate bowl or measuring cup, mix the warm water, olive oil, honey (or sugar), and apple cider vinegar. If the water is too hot, let it cool slightly; you want it warm, not hot, as that can kill the yeast.\n\n3. **Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients**: Pour the wet mixture into the bowl with dry ingredients. Stir well with a spoon or spatula until the mixture is fully combined and forms a soft dough. The dough will be slightly sticky, which is normal for gluten-free dough.\n\n4. **Let the Dough Rest**: Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap, and let the dough rest for about 20-30 minutes. This resting time helps the dough to hydrate and gives it a better texture.\n\n5. **Preheat the Oven**: While the dough is resting, preheat your oven to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat up.\n\n6. **Shape the Dough**: After the resting period, sprinkle a little gluten-free flour on a clean surface. Transfer the dough onto the floured surface. You can split the dough in half if you are making two pizzas. Use your hands or a rolling pin to shape the dough into your desired pizza shape and thickness (about \u00bc inch thick works nicely). If the dough is sticking, use more flour as needed.\n\n7. **Prepare for Baking**: Transfer the shaped pizza dough onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or onto a preheated pizza stone. For extra flavor, brush a little olive oil on the top of the dough, and if you like, add herbs like oregano or basil.\n\n8. **Pre-Bake the Crust**: Bake the dough in the preheated oven for about 10-12 minutes, or until it starts to turn golden brown. Keep an eye on it to avoid overbaking.\n\n9. **Add Your Toppings**: Remove the pre-baked crust from the oven and add your favorite sauce, cheese, and toppings. Get creative with your choices!\n\n10. **Final Baking**: Place the topped pizza back in the oven and bake for another 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly, and the crust is cooked through.\n\n11. **Serve**: Remove from the oven, let it cool for a minute, and then slice and serve hot!\n\nEnjoy your delicious gluten-free pizza! The dough should be crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.\n\nProvide your evaluation in the following format:\n\"explanation\": \"Detailed explanation of your evaluation, citing specific ingredients or methods\",\n\"label\": \"PASS\" or \"FAIL\"\n","18":"You are an expert nutritionist and dietary specialist evaluating whether recipe responses properly adhere to specified dietary restrictions.\n\nDIETARY RESTRICTION DEFINITIONS:\n- Vegan: No animal products (meat, dairy, eggs, honey, etc.)\n- Vegetarian: No meat or fish, but dairy and eggs are allowed\n- Gluten-free: No wheat, barley, rye, or other gluten-containing grains\n- Dairy-free: No milk, cheese, butter, yogurt, or other dairy products\n- Keto: Very low carb (typically <20g net carbs), high fat, moderate protein\n- Paleo: No grains, legumes, dairy, refined sugar, or processed foods\n- Pescatarian: No meat except fish and seafood\n- Kosher: Follows Jewish dietary laws (no pork, shellfish, mixing meat\/dairy)\n- Halal: Follows Islamic dietary laws (no pork, alcohol, proper slaughter)\n- Nut-free: No tree nuts or peanuts\n- Low-carb: Significantly reduced carbohydrates (typically <50g per day)\n- Sugar-free: No added sugars or high-sugar ingredients\n- Raw vegan: Vegan foods not heated above 118\u00b0F (48\u00b0C)\n- Whole30: No grains, dairy, legumes, sugar, alcohol, or processed foods\n- Diabetic-friendly: Low glycemic index, controlled carbohydrates\n- Low-sodium: Reduced sodium content for heart health\n\nEVALUATION CRITERIA:\n- PASS: The recipe clearly adheres to the dietary preferences with appropriate ingredients and preparation methods\n- FAIL: The recipe contains ingredients or methods that violate the dietary preferences\n- Consider both explicit ingredients and cooking methods\n\nHere are some examples of how to evaluate dietary adherence:\n\n\nExample 1:\nQuery and Response: Here's a delicious, creamy Vegan Protein Smoothie recipe that you'll love!

Keeping the broth warm will help the rice cook evenly.\n\n2. **Saut\u00e9 the Aromatics:** In a medium-sized heavy-bottomed pot, heat the olive oil and butter over medium heat. Once the butter has melted, add the chopped onion. Saut\u00e9 for about 3-4 minutes, or until the onion becomes translucent. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.\n\n3. **Cook the Mushrooms:** Toss in the sliced mushrooms and cook until they release their moisture and begin to brown, about 5-7 minutes. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper to enhance the flavor. Remove half of the mushrooms and set aside for garnish later.\n\n4. **Toast the Rice:** Add the Arborio rice to the pot and stir it constantly for about 2-3 minutes. This will toast the rice and help it absorb flavor.\n\n5. **Add the Broth Gradually:** Start adding the warm broth, one ladleful at a time, to the rice.

It's rich in flavor yet made with wholesome ingredients. This recipe serves 2 people.\n\n### Creamy Mushroom Risotto\n\n**Ingredients:**\n- 1 cup Arborio rice\n- 2 cups low-sodium vegetable broth (or chicken broth)\n- 1 cup mushrooms, sliced (such as cremini or button)\n- 1 small onion, finely chopped\n- 2 cloves garlic, minced\n- 1 tablespoon olive oil\n- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter\n- 1\/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese (optional)\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Prepare the Broth:** In a small saucepan, heat the vegetable or chicken broth over low heat and let it simmer. Keeping the broth warm will help the rice cook evenly.\n\n2. **Saut\u00e9 the Aromatics:** In a medium-sized heavy-bottomed pot, heat the olive oil and butter over medium heat. Once the butter has melted, add the chopped onion. Saut\u00e9 for about 3-4 minutes, or until the onion becomes translucent. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.\n\n3. **Cook the Mushrooms:** Toss in the sliced mushrooms and cook until they release their moisture and begin to brown, about 5-7 minutes. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper to enhance the flavor. Remove half of the mushrooms and set aside for garnish later.\n\n4. **Toast the Rice:** Add the Arborio rice to the pot and stir it constantly for about 2-3 minutes. This will toast the rice and help it absorb flavor.\n\n5. **Add the Broth Gradually:** Start adding the warm broth, one ladleful at a time, to the rice. Stir constantly and allow the rice to absorb the liquid before adding more. This process will take about 18-20 minutes. The risotto is done when the rice is creamy and al dente, with a slight bite left to it.\n\n6. **Finish with Cheese and Seasoning:** Once the rice is cooked to your desired consistency, remove it from the heat. If you\u2019re using Parmesan cheese, stir it in at this point for extra creaminess. Taste and adjust seasoning with more salt and pepper as needed.\n\n7. **Serve:** Spoon the risotto into bowls and top with the reserved saut\u00e9ed mushrooms.

Keeping the broth warm will help the rice cook evenly.\n\n2. **Saut\u00e9 the Aromatics:** In a medium-sized heavy-bottomed pot, heat the olive oil and butter over medium heat. Once the butter has melted, add the chopped onion. Saut\u00e9 for about 3-4 minutes, or until the onion becomes translucent.

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper to enhance the flavor. Remove half of the mushrooms and set aside for garnish later.\n\n4. **Toast the Rice:** Add the Arborio rice to the pot and stir it constantly for about 2-3 minutes.

It's rich in flavor yet made with wholesome ingredients. This recipe serves 2 people.\n\n### Creamy Mushroom Risotto\n\n**Ingredients:**\n- 1 cup Arborio rice\n- 2 cups low-sodium vegetable broth (or chicken broth)\n- 1 cup mushrooms, sliced (such as cremini or button)\n- 1 small onion, finely chopped\n- 2 cloves garlic, minced\n- 1 tablespoon olive oil\n- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter\n- 1\/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese (optional)\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Prepare the Broth:** In a small saucepan, heat the vegetable or chicken broth over low heat and let it simmer. Keeping the broth warm will help the rice cook evenly.\n\n2. **Saut\u00e9 the Aromatics:** In a medium-sized heavy-bottomed pot, heat the olive oil and butter over medium heat. Once the butter has melted, add the chopped onion. Saut\u00e9 for about 3-4 minutes, or until the onion becomes translucent. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.\n\n3. **Cook the Mushrooms:** Toss in the sliced mushrooms and cook until they release their moisture and begin to brown, about 5-7 minutes. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper to enhance the flavor. Remove half of the mushrooms and set aside for garnish later.\n\n4. **Toast the Rice:** Add the Arborio rice to the pot and stir it constantly for about 2-3 minutes. This will toast the rice and help it absorb flavor.\n\n5. **Add the Broth Gradually:** Start adding the warm broth, one ladleful at a time, to the rice. Stir constantly and allow the rice to absorb the liquid before adding more. This process will take about 18-20 minutes. The risotto is done when the rice is creamy and al dente, with a slight bite left to it.\n\n6. **Finish with Cheese and Seasoning:** Once the rice is cooked to your desired consistency, remove it from the heat. If you\u2019re using Parmesan cheese, stir it in at this point for extra creaminess. Taste and adjust seasoning with more salt and pepper as needed.\n\n7. **Serve:** Spoon the risotto into bowls and top with the reserved saut\u00e9ed mushrooms. Garnish with freshly chopped parsley for a pop of color. Enjoy your indulgent yet wholesome meal!\n\nThis Creamy Mushroom Risotto offers a luxurious experience without being overly rich, making it a perfect choice for a comforting dinner for two!\nExplanation: The recipe for Creamy Mushroom Risotto includes Arborio rice, which is a high-glycemic index food and not ideal for a diabetic-friendly diet. Additionally, the recipe uses Parmesan cheese, which is optional, but the presence of rice as the main ingredient is the primary concern. While the recipe uses low-sodium broth and unsalted butter, which are positive choices for reducing sodium and saturated fat, the carbohydrate content from the rice is significant and could impact blood sugar levels.

You can also cut a small slice off the bottom to help them stand upright (just be careful not to create a hole).\n\n3. **Cook Quinoa**: If you haven't already, rinse the quinoa under cold water. Cook it according to package instructions (usually 1 part quinoa to 2 parts water or broth) until fluffy. This usually takes about 15 minutes.\n\n4. **Mix the Filling**: In a mixing bowl, combine cooked quinoa, black beans, corn, cumin, chili powder, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Fold in the diced tomatoes. Adjust seasoning according to your preference.\n\n5. **Stuff the Peppers**: Spoon the quinoa mixture into each bell pepper until they are generously filled. If using cheese, sprinkle some on top of the stuffed mixture.\n\n6. **Bake**: Place the stuffed peppers upright in a baking dish and add a splash of water to the bottom (this helps steam the peppers). Cover the dish with foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil for the last 10 minutes of baking to allow the tops to brown slightly and the cheese to melt.\n\n7. **Serve**: Remove from the oven and let cool slightly.

It's rich in flavor yet made with wholesome ingredients. This recipe serves 2 people.\n\n### Creamy Mushroom Risotto\n\n**Ingredients:**\n- 1 cup Arborio rice\n- 2 cups low-sodium vegetable broth (or chicken broth)\n- 1 cup mushrooms, sliced (such as cremini or button)\n- 1 small onion, finely chopped\n- 2 cloves garlic, minced\n- 1 tablespoon olive oil\n- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter\n- 1\/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese (optional)\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Prepare the Broth:** In a small saucepan, heat the vegetable or chicken broth over low heat and let it simmer. Keeping the broth warm will help the rice cook evenly.\n\n2. **Saut\u00e9 the Aromatics:** In a medium-sized heavy-bottomed pot, heat the olive oil and butter over medium heat. Once the butter has melted, add the chopped onion. Saut\u00e9 for about 3-4 minutes, or until the onion becomes translucent. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.\n\n3. **Cook the Mushrooms:** Toss in the sliced mushrooms and cook until they release their moisture and begin to brown, about 5-7 minutes. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper to enhance the flavor. Remove half of the mushrooms and set aside for garnish later.\n\n4. **Toast the Rice:** Add the Arborio rice to the pot and stir it constantly for about 2-3 minutes.

The risotto is done when the rice is creamy and al dente, with a slight bite left to it.\n\n6. **Finish with Cheese and Seasoning:** Once the rice is cooked to your desired consistency, remove it from the heat. If you\u2019re using Parmesan cheese, stir it in at this point for extra creaminess.

Using a vegetable peeler or spiralizer, create 'noodles' from the zucchini. If using a peeler, simply peel long strips down the length of the zucchini until you reach the core. If using a spiralizer, turn it to create spirals. Aim for long, thin strips that resemble traditional pasta.\n   - Place the zucchini noodles in a bowl, sprinkle lightly with salt, and let them sit for about 10-15 minutes. This will allow them to release some of their moisture, making them a bit softer.\n\n2. **Make the Avocado Pesto:**\n   - While the zucchinis are sitting, prepare the avocado pesto. In a blender or food processor, combine the ripe avocado, basil leaves, lemon juice, nutritional yeast (if using), garlic clove, salt, and pepper. If you like a bit of creaminess, drizzle in the olive oil.\n   - Blend until smooth and creamy. You can adjust the consistency by adding a little water if you prefer a thinner pesto. Taste and adjust seasoning to your liking.\n\n3. **Combine the Ingredients:**\n   - Once the zucchini noodles have sat and softened slightly, shake off any excess moisture and add them to a serving bowl. Pour the avocado pesto over the noodles. Use a pair of tongs to gently toss the noodles with the pesto until everything is well coated.\n\n4. **Serve:**\n   - Divide the zucchini noodles into two serving plates. Cut the cherry tomatoes in half and sprinkle them on top for a burst of color and flavor. If desired, toast some pine nuts or walnuts lightly in a pan (without oil, as you want to keep it raw) and sprinkle them over the noodles for added crunch.\n   - Garnish with extra basil leaves if desired and serve immediately.\n\nEnjoy your delicious, filling raw vegan meal!\n\nProvide your evaluation in the following format:\n\"explanation\": \"Detailed explanation of your evaluation, citing specific ingredients or methods\",\n\"label\": \"PASS\" or \"FAIL\"\n","28":"You are an expert nutritionist and dietary specialist evaluating whether recipe responses properly adhere to specified dietary restrictions.\n\nDIETARY RESTRICTION DEFINITIONS:\n- Vegan: No animal products (meat, dairy, eggs, honey, etc.)\n- Vegetarian: No meat or fish, but dairy and eggs are allowed\n- Gluten-free: No wheat, barley, rye, or other gluten-containing grains\n- Dairy-free: No milk, cheese, butter, yogurt, or other dairy products\n- Keto: Very low carb (typically <20g net carbs), high fat, moderate protein\n- Paleo: No grains, legumes, dairy, refined sugar, or processed foods\n- Pescatarian: No meat except fish and seafood\n- Kosher: Follows Jewish dietary laws (no pork, shellfish, mixing meat\/dairy)\n- Halal: Follows Islamic dietary laws (no pork, alcohol, proper slaughter)\n- Nut-free: No tree nuts or peanuts\n- Low-carb: Significantly reduced carbohydrates (typically <50g per day)\n- Sugar-free: No added sugars or high-sugar ingredients\n- Raw vegan: Vegan foods not heated above 118\u00b0F (48\u00b0C)\n- Whole30: No grains, dairy, legumes, sugar, alcohol, or processed foods\n- Diabetic-friendly: Low glycemic index, controlled carbohydrates\n- Low-sodium: Reduced sodium content for heart health\n\nEVALUATION CRITERIA:\n- PASS: The recipe clearly adheres to the dietary preferences with appropriate ingredients and preparation methods\n- FAIL: The recipe contains ingredients or methods that violate the dietary preferences\n- Consider both explicit ingredients and cooking methods\n\nHere are some examples of how to evaluate dietary adherence:\n\n\nExample 1:\nQuery and Response: Here's a delicious, creamy Vegan Protein Smoothie recipe that you'll love!

Bake in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes, or until the cake has set and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with a few moist crumbs (not wet batter).\n\n7. **Cool**: Once baked, remove the cake from the oven and let it cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. Carefully run a knife around the edges to loosen it, then invert the cake onto a plate or serving platter. If you've used parchment paper, simply lift it off gently.\n\n8. **Serve**: Allow the cake to cool completely. Dust the top with additional cocoa powder for presentation or serve with fresh berries or whipped cream, if desired.\n\nEnjoy this indulgent flourless chocolate cake as a delightful conclusion to your Passover meal!\n\nProvide your evaluation in the following format:\n\"explanation\": \"Detailed explanation of your evaluation, citing specific ingredients or methods\",\n\"label\": \"PASS\" or \"FAIL\"\n","30":"You are an expert nutritionist and dietary specialist evaluating whether recipe responses properly adhere to specified dietary restrictions.\n\nDIETARY RESTRICTION DEFINITIONS:\n- Vegan: No animal products (meat, dairy, eggs, honey, etc.)\n- Vegetarian: No meat or fish, but dairy and eggs are allowed\n- Gluten-free: No wheat, barley, rye, or other gluten-containing grains\n- Dairy-free: No milk, cheese, butter, yogurt, or other dairy products\n- Keto: Very low carb (typically <20g net carbs), high fat, moderate protein\n- Paleo: No grains, legumes, dairy, refined sugar, or processed foods\n- Pescatarian: No meat except fish and seafood\n- Kosher: Follows Jewish dietary laws (no pork, shellfish, mixing meat\/dairy)\n- Halal: Follows Islamic dietary laws (no pork, alcohol, proper slaughter)\n- Nut-free: No tree nuts or peanuts\n- Low-carb: Significantly reduced carbohydrates (typically <50g per day)\n- Sugar-free: No added sugars or high-sugar ingredients\n- Raw vegan: Vegan foods not heated above 118\u00b0F (48\u00b0C)\n- Whole30: No grains, dairy, legumes, sugar, alcohol, or processed foods\n- Diabetic-friendly: Low glycemic index, controlled carbohydrates\n- Low-sodium: Reduced sodium content for heart health\n\nEVALUATION CRITERIA:\n- PASS: The recipe clearly adheres to the dietary preferences with appropriate ingredients and preparation methods\n- FAIL: The recipe contains ingredients or methods that violate the dietary preferences\n- Consider both explicit ingredients and cooking methods\n\nHere are some examples of how to evaluate dietary adherence:\n\n\nExample 1:\nQuery and Response: Here's a delicious, creamy Vegan Protein Smoothie recipe that you'll love!

This dish is packed with protein and can be served with a simple side of whole grains or a light salad if you feel adventurous. It serves 2 people.\n\n### Ingredients:\n- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts\n- 2 tablespoons olive oil\n- 1 teaspoon garlic powder\n- 1 teaspoon onion powder\n- 1 teaspoon dried thyme (or any herbs you prefer)\n- 1 teaspoon dried oregano\n- 1 teaspoon salt\n- \u00bd teaspoon black pepper\n- \u00bd cup breadcrumbs (you can use panko for extra crunch)\n- Juice of half a lemon (optional)\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. **Preheat the Oven**: Begin by preheating your oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C). This ensures that it reaches the perfect temperature for cooking your chicken, giving it a nice crispy crust.\n\n2. **Prepare the Chicken**: Pat the chicken breasts dry with paper towels. This step helps the seasoning adhere better and promotes even cooking. Place the chicken breasts in a shallow dish.\n\n3. **Make the Herb Mixture**: In a small bowl, combine the olive oil, garlic powder, onion powder, dried thyme, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper. Mix until it forms a cohesive paste.\n\n4. **Coat the Chicken**: Using a brush or your hands, evenly coat each chicken breast with the herb mixture. Ensure that the chicken is well covered, as this will add fantastic flavor and create a lovely crust during baking.\n\n5. **Add the Breadcrumbs**: Place the breadcrumbs in a shallow dish. Gently press each coated chicken breast into the breadcrumbs, ensuring both sides are covered. The breadcrumbs will provide a crispy texture once baked.\n\n6. **Bake the Chicken**: Lay the breadcrumb-coated chicken breasts on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or in a lightly greased baking dish. If you want to enhance the flavor, squeeze the juice of half a lemon over the chicken before placing it in the oven.\n\n7. **Cook**: Bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and the internal temperature reaches 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C). The outside should be golden brown and crispy.\n\n8. **Rest and Serve**: Once cooked, remove the chicken from the oven and allow it to rest for 5 minutes.

It's rich in flavor yet made with wholesome ingredients. This recipe serves 2 people.\n\n### Creamy Mushroom Risotto\n\n**Ingredients:**\n- 1 cup Arborio rice\n- 2 cups low-sodium vegetable broth (or chicken broth)\n- 1 cup mushrooms, sliced (such as cremini or button)\n- 1 small onion, finely chopped\n- 2 cloves garlic, minced\n- 1 tablespoon olive oil\n- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter\n- 1\/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese (optional)\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Prepare the Broth:** In a small saucepan, heat the vegetable or chicken broth over low heat and let it simmer. Keeping the broth warm will help the rice cook evenly.\n\n2. **Saut\u00e9 the Aromatics:** In a medium-sized heavy-bottomed pot, heat the olive oil and butter over medium heat. Once the butter has melted, add the chopped onion. Saut\u00e9 for about 3-4 minutes, or until the onion becomes translucent. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.\n\n3. **Cook the Mushrooms:** Toss in the sliced mushrooms and cook until they release their moisture and begin to brown, about 5-7 minutes. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper to enhance the flavor. Remove half of the mushrooms and set aside for garnish later.\n\n4. **Toast the Rice:** Add the Arborio rice to the pot and stir it constantly for about 2-3 minutes. This will toast the rice and help it absorb flavor.\n\n5. **Add the Broth Gradually:** Start adding the warm broth, one ladleful at a time, to the rice. Stir constantly and allow the rice to absorb the liquid before adding more. This process will take about 18-20 minutes. The risotto is done when the rice is creamy and al dente, with a slight bite left to it.\n\n6. **Finish with Cheese and Seasoning:** Once the rice is cooked to your desired consistency, remove it from the heat. If you\u2019re using Parmesan cheese, stir it in at this point for extra creaminess. Taste and adjust seasoning with more salt and pepper as needed.\n\n7. **Serve:** Spoon the risotto into bowls and top with the reserved saut\u00e9ed mushrooms. Garnish with freshly chopped parsley for a pop of color. Enjoy your indulgent yet wholesome meal!\n\nThis Creamy Mushroom Risotto offers a luxurious experience without being overly rich, making it a perfect choice for a comforting dinner for two!\nExplanation: The recipe for Creamy Mushroom Risotto includes Arborio rice, which is a high-glycemic index food and not ideal for a diabetic-friendly diet. Additionally, the recipe uses Parmesan cheese, which is optional, but the presence of rice as the main ingredient is the primary concern. While the recipe uses low-sodium broth and unsalted butter, which are positive choices for reducing sodium and saturated fat, the carbohydrate content from the rice is significant and could impact blood sugar levels. Therefore, the recipe does not adhere to the diabetic-friendly dietary restriction.\nLabel: FAIL\n\n\nNow evaluate the following recipe response:\n\nQuery: Gluten-free birthday cake for my 5-year-old who has celiac but all her friends will be eating regular cake and I don't want her to feel left out\nDietary Restriction: gluten-free\nRecipe Response: Here\u2019s a delicious Gluten-Free Vanilla Birthday Cake recipe that will make your little one feel special on her big day while ensuring it's totally safe for her to enjoy!\n\n### Gluten-Free Vanilla Birthday Cake\n\n**Servings:** 2 (for a small cake, simply double the ingredients for a larger cake)\n\n#### Ingredients:\n- 1 cup almond flour\n- 1 cup gluten-free all-purpose flour (with xanthan gum if your blend doesn\u2019t already contain it)\n- 1 teaspoon baking powder\n- 1\/2 teaspoon baking soda\n- 1\/4 teaspoon salt\n- 1\/2 cup unsalted butter, softened (or coconut oil for dairy-free)\n- 1 cup granulated sugar\n- 2 large eggs\n- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract\n- 1\/2 cup milk (use almond milk for dairy-free)\n- Optional: Gluten-free sprinkles for decoration\n\n#### Instructions:\n\n1. **Preheat the Oven:** Start by preheating your oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). This ensures that the oven is hot enough when your batter is ready.\n\n2. **Prepare the Cake Pans:** Grease and line the bottoms of two 6-inch round cake pans with parchment paper. Greasing it helps prevent the cake from sticking, while the parchment allows for easy removal.\n\n3. **Mix Dry Ingredients:** In a medium bowl, whisk together the almond flour, gluten-free all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. This combination will ensure your cake has a light and fluffy texture.\n\n4. **Cream Butter and Sugar:** In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to beat the softened butter and granulated sugar together on medium speed until the mixture is light and fluffy (about 3-5 minutes). This step adds air to the batter, making the cake fluffy.\n\n5. **Incorporate Eggs and Vanilla:** Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Then, mix in the vanilla extract until fully combined.\n\n6. **Combine Dry and Wet Ingredients:** Gradually add the dry ingredient mixture into the wet mixture, alternating with the milk. Start and end with the dry ingredients, mixing gently until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can make the cake dense.\n\n7. **Bake the Cakes:** Divide the batter evenly between the two prepared pans. Smooth the tops with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.\n\n8. **Cool the Cakes:** Once baked, remove the cakes from the oven and let them cool in the pans for about 10 minutes. Then, carefully transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.\n\n9. **Frosting (Optional):** While the cakes are cooling, you can prepare your favorite gluten-free frosting. A simple buttercream made with powdered sugar, softened butter, and vanilla extract works beautifully. Just beat the ingredients together until smooth and fluffy.\n\n10. **Assemble the Cake:** Once the cakes are completely cooled, place one layer on a serving plate. Spread a layer of frosting on top, then place the second cake layer on top. Frost the top and sides of the cake, and decorate with gluten-free sprinkles if desired.\n\n11. **Serve:** Slice the cake and serve it up with love!

This dish is vibrant, nutritious, and packed with protein from quinoa, making it a perfect vegetarian option without beans. \n\n### Ingredients:\n- 2 large bell peppers (any color)\n- 1 cup quinoa\n- 2 cups vegetable broth (or water)\n- 1 cup fresh spinach, chopped\n- 1 small onion, diced\n- 2 cloves garlic, minced\n- 1 teaspoon olive oil\n- 1 teaspoon paprika\n- Salt and pepper, to taste\n- Optional: shredded cheese (like mozzarella or cheddar) for topping\n\n### Serving Size:\nThis recipe serves 2 people.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. **Prepare the Quinoa**: \n   - Rinse 1 cup of quinoa under cold water using a fine-mesh sieve. This helps remove the natural coating, called saponin, which can make quinoa taste bitter.\n   - In a medium saucepan, combine the rinsed quinoa and 2 cups of vegetable broth. Bring it to a boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover, and let it simmer for about 15 minutes, or until the quinoa has absorbed all the liquid and is fluffy. Remove from heat and let it sit covered for 5 minutes, then fluff it with a fork.\n\n2. **Prepare the Bell Peppers**: \n   - While the quinoa is cooking, preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C).\n   - Cut the tops off the bell peppers and remove the seeds. You can chop the tops (smaller pieces) and set them aside for later use.\n   - Place the hollowed-out peppers upright in a baking dish.\n\n3. **Make the Filling**: \n   - In a skillet over medium heat, add 1 teaspoon of olive oil. Once hot, add the diced onion and saut\u00e9 for about 3-4 minutes until it becomes translucent.\n   - Add the minced garlic and the chopped bell pepper tops to the skillet. Saut\u00e9 for another 2 minutes until fragrant.\n   - Stir in the cooked quinoa and chopped spinach. Add paprika, salt, and pepper to taste. Mix well until the spinach has wilted.\n\n4. **Stuff the Peppers**: \n   - Carefully spoon the quinoa and spinach mixture into each bell pepper, filling them generously. If you're using cheese, sprinkle a little on top of the stuffed peppers.\n\n5. **Bake**: \n   - Pour a small amount of water into the bottom of the baking dish (to help steam the peppers and keep them moist). Cover the dish with aluminum foil.\n   - Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. After that, remove the foil and bake for an additional 10 minutes, or until the peppers are tender and the tops are slightly golden.\n\n6. **Serve**: \n   - Remove the stuffed peppers from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes before serving. They can be garnished with additional herbs, cheese, or a sprinkle of lemon juice for added freshness.\n\nEnjoy your flavorful, protein-packed Quinoa & Spinach Stuffed Bell Peppers!\n\nProvide your evaluation in the following format:\n\"explanation\": \"Detailed explanation of your evaluation, citing specific ingredients or methods\",\n\"label\": \"PASS\" or \"FAIL\"\n","35":"You are an expert nutritionist and dietary specialist evaluating whether recipe responses properly adhere to specified dietary restrictions.\n\nDIETARY RESTRICTION DEFINITIONS:\n- Vegan: No animal products (meat, dairy, eggs, honey, etc.)\n- Vegetarian: No meat or fish, but dairy and eggs are allowed\n- Gluten-free: No wheat, barley, rye, or other gluten-containing grains\n- Dairy-free: No milk, cheese, butter, yogurt, or other dairy products\n- Keto: Very low carb (typically <20g net carbs), high fat, moderate protein\n- Paleo: No grains, legumes, dairy, refined sugar, or processed foods\n- Pescatarian: No meat except fish and seafood\n- Kosher: Follows Jewish dietary laws (no pork, shellfish, mixing meat\/dairy)\n- Halal: Follows Islamic dietary laws (no pork, alcohol, proper slaughter)\n- Nut-free: No tree nuts or peanuts\n- Low-carb: Significantly reduced carbohydrates (typically <50g per day)\n- Sugar-free: No added sugars or high-sugar ingredients\n- Raw vegan: Vegan foods not heated above 118\u00b0F (48\u00b0C)\n- Whole30: No grains, dairy, legumes, sugar, alcohol, or processed foods\n- Diabetic-friendly: Low glycemic index, controlled carbohydrates\n- Low-sodium: Reduced sodium content for heart health\n\nEVALUATION CRITERIA:\n- PASS: The recipe clearly adheres to the dietary preferences with appropriate ingredients and preparation methods\n- FAIL: The recipe contains ingredients or methods that violate the dietary preferences\n- Consider both explicit ingredients and cooking methods\n\nHere are some examples of how to evaluate dietary adherence:\n\n\nExample 1:\nQuery and Response: Here's a delicious, creamy Vegan Protein Smoothie recipe that you'll love!

It's rich in flavor yet made with wholesome ingredients. This recipe serves 2 people.\n\n### Creamy Mushroom Risotto\n\n**Ingredients:**\n- 1 cup Arborio rice\n- 2 cups low-sodium vegetable broth (or chicken broth)\n- 1 cup mushrooms, sliced (such as cremini or button)\n- 1 small onion, finely chopped\n- 2 cloves garlic, minced\n- 1 tablespoon olive oil\n- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter\n- 1\/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese (optional)\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Prepare the Broth:** In a small saucepan, heat the vegetable or chicken broth over low heat and let it simmer. Keeping the broth warm will help the rice cook evenly.\n\n2. **Saut\u00e9 the Aromatics:** In a medium-sized heavy-bottomed pot, heat the olive oil and butter over medium heat. Once the butter has melted, add the chopped onion. Saut\u00e9 for about 3-4 minutes, or until the onion becomes translucent. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.\n\n3. **Cook the Mushrooms:** Toss in the sliced mushrooms and cook until they release their moisture and begin to brown, about 5-7 minutes. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper to enhance the flavor. Remove half of the mushrooms and set aside for garnish later.\n\n4. **Toast the Rice:** Add the Arborio rice to the pot and stir it constantly for about 2-3 minutes. This will toast the rice and help it absorb flavor.\n\n5. **Add the Broth Gradually:** Start adding the warm broth, one ladleful at a time, to the rice. Stir constantly and allow the rice to absorb the liquid before adding more. This process will take about 18-20 minutes. The risotto is done when the rice is creamy and al dente, with a slight bite left to it.\n\n6. **Finish with Cheese and Seasoning:** Once the rice is cooked to your desired consistency, remove it from the heat. If you\u2019re using Parmesan cheese, stir it in at this point for extra creaminess. Taste and adjust seasoning with more salt and pepper as needed.\n\n7. **Serve:** Spoon the risotto into bowls and top with the reserved saut\u00e9ed mushrooms.

Once done, reserve about 1\/2 cup of the pasta water, then drain the pasta and set it aside.\n\n2. **Saut\u00e9 Spinach and Garlic:**  \n   In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and saut\u00e9 for about 1 minute, or until it's fragrant. Be careful not to burn it. Next, add the spinach and cook until wilted (if using fresh, about 2-3 minutes; if using frozen, just heat through). \n\n3. **Create the Creamy Sauce:**  \n   Pour in the vegetable broth and bring it to a simmer. Stir in the coconut milk (or almond milk) and let it cook for a minute to integrate the flavors. If you want, a pinch of grated nutmeg can add a lovely warmth to the sauce.\n\n4. **Combine Pasta and Sauce:**  \n   Add the cooked pasta to the skillet while tossing everything together. If the sauce seems too thick, add a little of the reserved pasta water until you achieve your desired consistency. If using cheese, sprinkle it in now, stirring until melted and creamy.\n\n5. **Season to Taste:**  \n   Season with salt, pepper, and a squeeze of lemon juice for some brightness. Toss everything gently to combine and let it heat through for about another minute.\n\n6. **Serve:**  \n   Divide the creamy pasta into bowls and finish with some fresh basil or parsley for a pop of color.

This helps remove any bitterness from its outer coating, called saponin.\n\n2. **Cook the Quinoa**: In a medium saucepan, add the rinsed quinoa and vegetable broth (or water). Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 15 minutes, or until all the liquid is absorbed and the quinoa is fluffy.

Cook for another 5-7 minutes, until the mushrooms are browned and tender.\n\n4. **Add the Spinach**: Stir in the fresh spinach, and cook until wilted, approximately 2 minutes. If your skillet is very full, you can add the spinach a handful at a time, allowing it to wilt before adding more.\n\n5. **Incorporate the Creaminess**: Reduce the heat to low and add the cream cheese (or Greek yogurt) to the skillet. Stir well to combine, allowing it to melt and create a creamy sauce. Add the dried thyme, salt, and pepper to taste. If the mixture seems too thick, you can add a splash of water or vegetable broth to loosen it up.\n\n6. **Combine with Quinoa**: Once the cream cheese is fully mixed in, stir the fluffy quinoa into the skillet with the creamy spinach and mushroom mixture. Mix thoroughly to ensure every grain of quinoa is coated in that delicious sauce.\n\n7. **Serve**: Divide the creamy quinoa mixture between two plates. If desired, sprinkle some grated Parmesan cheese on top for an extra indulgent touch.\n\n### Enjoy:\nThis **Creamy Spinach and Mushroom Quinoa** is not only a wholesome meal, but it also satisfies your craving for something rich and indulgent!

Therefore, this recipe is suitable for a vegan diet.","19":"The recipe for the Chickpea and Quinoa Salad Bowl adheres to the vegetarian dietary restriction. It includes plant-based ingredients such as quinoa and chickpeas, which are excellent sources of protein. The optional feta cheese is permissible in a vegetarian diet, as dairy products are allowed. There are no meat or fish products included in the recipe, and all other ingredients are plant-based or vegetarian-friendly.","20":"The recipe for One-Pan Garlic Herb Chicken and Vegetables adheres to the paleo dietary restriction. It includes whole, unprocessed ingredients such as chicken, mixed vegetables, garlic, olive oil, and herbs. There are no grains, legumes, dairy, refined sugar, or processed foods included in the recipe. The preparation method of roasting is also consistent with paleo principles.","21":"The recipe for Almond Flour Chocolate Chip Cookies uses almond flour, which is lower in carbohydrates than regular flour, making it more suitable for a diabetic-friendly diet. However, the recipe includes honey or pure maple syrup as a sweetener. Both honey and maple syrup have a high glycemic index and can cause blood sugar spikes, which is not ideal for a diabetic-friendly diet. While the recipe avoids artificial sweeteners, it does not adequately control carbohydrate intake due to the use of these natural sweeteners.","22":"The recipe for Halal Grilled Chicken Skewers with Garlic Yogurt Sauce adheres to the halal dietary restriction. The ingredients used, such as chicken, olive oil, spices, and yogurt, are all permissible under halal guidelines. The recipe does not include any prohibited items such as pork or alcohol. Additionally, the preparation method does not involve any non-halal practices. It is important to ensure that the chicken is sourced from a halal-certified supplier, and the yogurt does not contain any non-halal additives.","23":"The recipe for Paleo Chicken Salad Lettuce Wraps adheres to the Paleo dietary restriction as it avoids grains, legumes, dairy, refined sugar, and processed foods. The ingredients listed, such as chicken, vegetables, avocado, and paleo-friendly mayonnaise, are all compliant with the Paleo diet. Additionally, the recipe does not include any nuts, which aligns with the request to avoid nuts due to an allergy, except for almonds which are not included in the recipe. The preparation methods, such as using lettuce leaves as wraps, are also consistent with Paleo principles.","24":"The recipe for Sugar-Free Chocolate Avocado Mousse adheres to the sugar-free dietary restriction. It uses a sugar-free sweetener (erythritol or stevia) instead of sugar, and all other ingredients (avocado, unsweetened cocoa powder, almond milk, vanilla extract, and salt) do not contain added sugars. The optional garnish of sugar-free dark chocolate shavings is also compliant with the sugar-free requirement. The preparation method does not introduce any sugar-containing ingredients.","25":"The recipe for Quinoa and Black Bean Stuffed Bell Peppers adheres to the vegetarian dietary restriction. It contains no meat or fish, and the optional use of shredded cheese is permissible within a vegetarian diet. All other ingredients, such as quinoa, black beans, corn, and spices, are plant-based and suitable for vegetarians. The preparation method of baking the stuffed peppers does not introduce any non-vegetarian elements.","26":"The recipe is intended to be raw vegan, which means it should not include any animal products and should not be heated above 118\u00b0F. The ingredients listed are mostly raw and plant-based, such as cherry tomatoes, cucumber, bell pepper, red onion, kalamata olives, avocado, parsley, lemon juice, and extra-virgin olive oil. However, the inclusion of chickpeas is problematic. Canned or cooked chickpeas are typically not considered raw, as they are usually cooked during processing. Additionally, the optional ingredient of crumbled feta cheese is not vegan, although the recipe does offer nutritional yeast as a vegan alternative. Despite the feta being optional, the presence of cooked chickpeas violates the raw vegan restriction.","27":"The recipe for Raw Vegan Zucchini Noodles with Avocado Pesto adheres to the raw vegan dietary restriction. All ingredients used are plant-based and do not involve any animal products, which satisfies the vegan requirement. Additionally, the preparation method does not involve heating any ingredients above 118\u00b0F, which aligns with the raw food criteria. The use of fresh vegetables, avocado, and nuts is consistent with raw vegan principles. The optional toasting of nuts is specified to be without oil and is not heated, maintaining the raw aspect. Nutritional yeast, while optional, is a deactivated yeast and is commonly used in raw vegan diets for flavor. Overall, the recipe meets the raw vegan standards.","28":"The recipe adheres to the vegan dietary restriction as it contains no animal products. The ingredients used are all plant-based, including cashews, lemon juice, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, olive oil, and fresh herbs. The preparation method involves soaking and blending, which does not involve any non-vegan processes. The optional use of olive oil and fresh herbs does not violate vegan principles. The recipe also respects the user's preference by not including nutritional yeast and only using cashews as the nut base.","29":"The recipe for Flourless Chocolate Cake adheres to the kosher dietary restriction for Passover. The ingredients listed, such as dark chocolate, unsalted butter, granulated sugar, eggs, vanilla extract, unsweetened cocoa powder, and salt, are all permissible for Passover, provided they are certified kosher for Passover. The recipe does not include any leavening agents or grains that are prohibited during Passover. Additionally, the preparation method does not involve mixing meat and dairy, which is a key consideration in kosher cooking. The use of butter is acceptable as long as it is kosher for Passover, and the chocolate must also be certified kosher for Passover.","30":"The recipe adheres to the gluten-free dietary restriction by using gluten-free all-purpose flour and almond flour, both of which are suitable for someone with celiac disease. The recipe also suggests using xanthan gum if the gluten-free flour blend does not already contain it, which is a common practice to mimic the binding properties of gluten. All other ingredients, such as baking powder, baking soda, and vanilla extract, are naturally gluten-free. The recipe also provides a dairy-free option by substituting coconut oil for butter and almond milk for regular milk, which is helpful for those who may also have dairy sensitivities. The preparation methods do not introduce any gluten contamination, as long as cross-contamination is avoided in the kitchen.","31":"The recipe for Zucchini Noodles with Avocado Pesto adheres to the low-carb dietary restriction. Zucchini is a low-carb vegetable, and the avocado pesto made with avocado, basil, lemon juice, and olive oil is also low in carbohydrates. The optional ingredients, such as cherry tomatoes and Parmesan cheese, are used in small amounts and do not significantly increase the carbohydrate content. The recipe does not include any high-carb ingredients, making it suitable for a low-carb diet.","32":"The recipe for Zucchini Noodles with Avocado Pesto and Cherry Tomatoes adheres to the Paleo dietary restriction as it does not include any grains, legumes, dairy, refined sugar, or processed foods. The main ingredients such as zucchini, avocado, basil, garlic, olive oil, lemon juice, and cherry tomatoes are all compliant with the Paleo diet. The recipe suggests omitting Parmesan cheese if strictly following Paleo, which is appropriate. Additionally, the recipe is nut-free, as requested, since almonds are not included and the user specified they are allergic to other nuts.","33":"The recipe adheres to the paleo dietary restriction. It uses ground beef or turkey, which are acceptable protein sources on a paleo diet. Almond flour is used instead of grain-based flours, aligning with the paleo avoidance of grains. The recipe includes zucchini noodles instead of traditional pasta, which is compliant with paleo guidelines. The marinara sauce is specified to be paleo-friendly, meaning it should not contain added sugars or non-paleo ingredients. Olive oil is used for cooking, which is a suitable fat source for paleo. No dairy, grains, legumes, or processed foods are included, which are typically avoided in a paleo diet.","34":"The recipe for Quinoa & Spinach Stuffed Bell Peppers adheres to the vegetarian dietary restriction. It includes quinoa as the primary protein source, which is a plant-based ingredient suitable for vegetarians. The recipe does not include any meat or fish, and the optional use of cheese is permissible within a vegetarian diet. All other ingredients, such as bell peppers, spinach, onion, garlic, and olive oil, are plant-based and align with vegetarian guidelines.","35":"The recipe for Creamy Spinach and Cheese Pasta includes an optional ingredient of shredded cheese, which is a dairy product. The dietary restriction specified is dairy-free, which means no dairy products should be included. Although the recipe suggests that cheese is optional, the presence of cheese as an ingredient does not fully adhere to a strict dairy-free guideline. The use of coconut milk or almond milk as alternatives for creaminess is appropriate for a dairy-free diet, but the inclusion of cheese, even as an option, violates the restriction.","36":"The recipe for Chocolate Avocado Mousse adheres to the dairy-free dietary restriction as it does not include any dairy products such as milk, cheese, butter, or yogurt. The main ingredients are avocado, unsweetened cocoa powder, maple syrup (or honey), vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt, none of which are dairy products. The recipe also explicitly avoids coconut milk, which the user dislikes. Optional toppings like fresh berries, sliced bananas, cacao nibs, or nuts are also dairy-free. The preparation method does not involve any dairy products either.","37":"The recipe for Lemon Herb Grilled Chicken with Quinoa Salad does not adhere to the Whole30 dietary restriction. Whole30 prohibits grains, and quinoa is a grain, which makes it non-compliant with the Whole30 guidelines. Additionally, the use of vegetable broth could potentially contain non-compliant ingredients unless specifically verified as Whole30-approved. Therefore, the inclusion of quinoa in the salad results in a failure to meet the Whole30 criteria.","38":"The recipe provided is for Garlic Shrimp Pasta, which includes shrimp as the main protein source. Since the dietary restriction is pescatarian, which allows for fish and seafood but no other meat, the inclusion of shrimp is appropriate. All other ingredients, such as pasta, garlic, olive oil, cherry tomatoes, lemon, and optional Parmesan cheese, are also suitable for a pescatarian diet. The recipe does not include any non-seafood meat products, thus adhering to the pescatarian dietary restriction.","39":"The recipe for Lemon Garlic Butter Baked Salmon adheres to the pescatarian dietary restriction as it includes fish (salmon) and avoids any meat products. The recipe also avoids shellfish, which is important given the query specifies an intolerance to shellfish. The use of butter is acceptable in a pescatarian diet, as it does not exclude dairy products. All other ingredients, such as garlic, lemon, and parsley, are plant-based and fit within the pescatarian guidelines.","40":"The recipe for Creamy Spinach and Mushroom Quinoa includes ingredients that may not be ideal for a diabetic-friendly diet. While quinoa is a whole grain with a moderate glycemic index, it still contains carbohydrates that need to be considered in a diabetic diet. The use of low-fat cream cheese or Greek yogurt adds some carbohydrates and sugars, which could impact blood sugar levels. Additionally, the optional Parmesan cheese topping, while not high in carbs, could add unnecessary calories and fats. The recipe does not explicitly mention portion control or carbohydrate counting, which are important for managing diabetes. Therefore, while the recipe is generally healthy, it may not strictly adhere to diabetic-friendly guidelines without further modifications or considerations.","41":"The recipe for Garlic Butter Shrimp with Zucchini Noodles adheres to the keto dietary restriction. It uses shrimp and zucchini noodles, which are low in carbohydrates. The use of butter and optional Parmesan cheese provides the high-fat content typical of a keto diet. The recipe avoids high-carb ingredients and focuses on low-carb vegetables and protein, making it suitable for a keto meal."},"ground_truth_confidence":{"0":"HIGH","1":"HIGH","2":"HIGH","3":"HIGH","4":"HIGH","5":"HIGH","6":"HIGH","7":"HIGH","8":"HIGH","9":"HIGH","10":"HIGH","11":"HIGH","12":"HIGH","13":"HIGH","14":"HIGH","15":"HIGH","16":"HIGH","17":"HIGH","18":"HIGH","19":"HIGH","20":"HIGH","21":"HIGH","22":"HIGH","23":"HIGH","24":"HIGH","25":"HIGH","26":"HIGH","27":"HIGH","28":"HIGH","29":"HIGH","30":"HIGH","31":"HIGH","32":"HIGH","33":"HIGH","34":"HIGH","35":"HIGH","36":"HIGH","37":"HIGH","38":"HIGH","39":"HIGH","40":"MEDIUM","41":"HIGH"},"prompt_y":{"0":"You are an expert nutritionist and dietary specialist.

In a medium saucepan, combine the rinsed quinoa and vegetable broth (or water). Bring it to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to low. Cover and simmer for about 15 minutes, or until the quinoa is fluffy and the liquid is absorbed. Once cooked, fluff it with a fork and set aside.\n\n3. **Roast the Vegetables:**\n   On a large baking sheet, toss the diced zucchini, bell pepper, carrot, and red onion with olive oil, salt, pepper, and dried oregano. Spread the vegetables out in a single layer. Roast in the preheated oven for about 20 minutes, stirring halfway through, until they are tender and slightly caramelized.\n\n4. **Combine Ingredients:**\n   In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooked quinoa and roasted vegetables. Drizzle with fresh lemon juice to add brightness and stir gently to mix everything together. Taste and adjust salt and pepper as needed.\n\n5. **Serve:**\n   Divide the quinoa salad between two bowls or plates. If desired, garnish with chopped fresh parsley or basil for a burst of color and freshness. \n\nThis light yet filling quinoa salad is not only nourishing but also packed with flavors, making it a perfect meal for a healthy lunch or dinner!

This recipe serves 2 people.\n\n### Cauliflower Crust Pizza\n\n#### Ingredients:\n- 1 medium head of cauliflower (about 4 cups when riced)\n- 1 large egg\n- 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese (you can use low-fat for a healthier option)\n- 1\/2 teaspoon garlic powder\n- 1\/2 teaspoon onion powder\n- 1\/2 teaspoon dried oregano (or Italian seasoning)\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- 1\/2 cup pizza sauce (look for a low-sugar option, or make your own)\n- 1 cup assorted toppings (like sliced bell peppers, mushrooms, spinach, or olives)\n- Extra shredded cheese for topping (optional)\n\n#### Instructions:\n\n1. **Prep the Cauliflower:** Start by preheating your oven to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C). Wash the cauliflower and chop it into florets. Place the cauliflower florets in a food processor and pulse until it resembles rice or fine crumbs. If you don't have a food processor, you can also use a box grater.\n\n2. **Cook the Cauliflower:** Transfer the riced cauliflower to a microwave-safe bowl and microwave it for about 5-6 minutes, until softened. Carefully remove it from the microwave, let it cool slightly, and then place it in a clean kitchen towel.

Whisk the ingredients together until well blended.\n\n2. **Prepare the Chicken:** Cut the boneless chicken breasts into cubes, approximately 1-1.5 inches in size. This size helps them cook evenly on the grill.\n\n3. **Marinate the Chicken:** Add the chicken cubes into the marinade, ensuring they are well coated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or transfer to a ziplock bag. Allow the chicken to marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes, but up to 2 hours for more flavor.\n\n4. **Prepare the Vegetables (optional):** If you\u2019re adding vegetables, cut them into similar-sized chunks to the chicken.

If you\u2019re using a charcoal grill, wait until the coals are covered with ash and glowing.\n\n6. **Assemble the Skewers:** Once marinated, thread the chicken cubes onto the skewers, alternating with vegetable pieces if you're using them. Leave a little space between each piece to allow for even cooking.\n\n7. **Grill the Skewers:** Place the skewers on the preheated grill. Grill for about 10-15 minutes, turning occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through and has nice grill marks. The internal temperature should reach 165\u00b0F (75\u00b0C).\n\n8. **Rest and Serve:** Once cooked, remove the skewers from the grill and let them rest for about 5 minutes. This helps the juices redistribute, making the chicken moist.

Here\u2019s a delicious recipe for gluten-free pizza dough that is both flavorful and has a great texture. This recipe yields enough dough for two medium pizzas, serving about 2 people.\n\n### Gluten-Free Pizza Dough Recipe\n\n#### Ingredients:\n- 1 \u00bd cups gluten-free all-purpose flour (look for one that contains xanthan gum)\n- 1 teaspoon baking powder\n- \u00bd teaspoon salt\n- 1 teaspoon garlic powder (optional for flavor)\n- \u00be cup warm water (about 110\u00b0F or 43\u00b0C)\n- 2 tablespoons olive oil\n- 1 teaspoon honey or sugar (to help with browning)\n- 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar\n\n#### Instructions:\n\n1. **Prepare the Dry Ingredients**: In a medium mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free all-purpose flour, baking powder, salt, and garlic powder (if using). Whisk these dry ingredients together until they are well blended and there are no lumps.\n\n2. **Mix the Wet Ingredients**: In a separate bowl or measuring cup, mix the warm water, olive oil, honey (or sugar), and apple cider vinegar. If the water is too hot, let it cool slightly; you want it warm, not hot, as that can kill the yeast.\n\n3. **Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients**: Pour the wet mixture into the bowl with dry ingredients. Stir well with a spoon or spatula until the mixture is fully combined and forms a soft dough. The dough will be slightly sticky, which is normal for gluten-free dough.\n\n4. **Let the Dough Rest**: Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap, and let the dough rest for about 20-30 minutes. This resting time helps the dough to hydrate and gives it a better texture.\n\n5. **Preheat the Oven**: While the dough is resting, preheat your oven to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat up.\n\n6. **Shape the Dough**: After the resting period, sprinkle a little gluten-free flour on a clean surface. Transfer the dough onto the floured surface. You can split the dough in half if you are making two pizzas. Use your hands or a rolling pin to shape the dough into your desired pizza shape and thickness (about \u00bc inch thick works nicely). If the dough is sticking, use more flour as needed.\n\n7. **Prepare for Baking**: Transfer the shaped pizza dough onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or onto a preheated pizza stone. For extra flavor, brush a little olive oil on the top of the dough, and if you like, add herbs like oregano or basil.\n\n8. **Pre-Bake the Crust**: Bake the dough in the preheated oven for about 10-12 minutes, or until it starts to turn golden brown. Keep an eye on it to avoid overbaking.\n\n9. **Add Your Toppings**: Remove the pre-baked crust from the oven and add your favorite sauce, cheese, and toppings. Get creative with your choices!\n\n10. **Final Baking**: Place the topped pizza back in the oven and bake for another 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly, and the crust is cooked through.\n\n11. **Serve**: Remove from the oven, let it cool for a minute, and then slice and serve hot!\n\nEnjoy your delicious gluten-free pizza!

This recipe serves 2.\n\n### Ingredients:\n- 1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved\n- 1 cucumber, diced\n- 1 bell pepper (red or yellow), diced\n- 1 small red onion, finely chopped\n- 1 cup chickpeas, rinsed and drained (canned or cooked)\n- 1\/4 cup kalamata olives, pitted and sliced\n- 1 avocado, diced\n- Fresh parsley, chopped (about 1\/4 cup)\n- Juice of 1 lemon\n- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\n- Salt and pepper, to taste\n- Optional: Crumbled feta cheese or nutritional yeast for a vegan cheesy flavor\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. **Prepare the Vegetables**: In a large bowl, combine the cherry tomatoes, cucumber, bell pepper, red onion, and chickpeas. Make sure the vegetables are fresh and crisp for the best flavor.\n\n2. **Add Olives and Avocado**: Gently fold in the kalamata olives and diced avocado. The avocado adds a creaminess that enhances the overall taste and texture of the salad.\n\n3. **Mix the Dressing**: In a small bowl or measuring cup, whisk together the lemon juice and olive oil. Add salt and pepper to taste. This simple dressing brightens the salad and ties all the ingredients together.\n\n4. **Combine and Toss**: Pour the dressing over the salad mixture and toss gently to ensure everything is well coated.

Fresh herbs elevate the flavor significantly and add an aromatic touch.\n\n6. **Taste and Adjust**: Taste your salad and adjust the seasoning if necessary.

Using a vegetable peeler or spiralizer, create 'noodles' from the zucchini. If using a peeler, simply peel long strips down the length of the zucchini until you reach the core. If using a spiralizer, turn it to create spirals. Aim for long, thin strips that resemble traditional pasta.\n   - Place the zucchini noodles in a bowl, sprinkle lightly with salt, and let them sit for about 10-15 minutes. This will allow them to release some of their moisture, making them a bit softer.\n\n2. **Make the Avocado Pesto:**\n   - While the zucchinis are sitting, prepare the avocado pesto. In a blender or food processor, combine the ripe avocado, basil leaves, lemon juice, nutritional yeast (if using), garlic clove, salt, and pepper. If you like a bit of creaminess, drizzle in the olive oil.\n   - Blend until smooth and creamy. You can adjust the consistency by adding a little water if you prefer a thinner pesto. Taste and adjust seasoning to your liking.\n\n3. **Combine the Ingredients:**\n   - Once the zucchini noodles have sat and softened slightly, shake off any excess moisture and add them to a serving bowl. Pour the avocado pesto over the noodles. Use a pair of tongs to gently toss the noodles with the pesto until everything is well coated.\n\n4. **Serve:**\n   - Divide the zucchini noodles into two serving plates. Cut the cherry tomatoes in half and sprinkle them on top for a burst of color and flavor. If desired, toast some pine nuts or walnuts lightly in a pan (without oil, as you want to keep it raw) and sprinkle them over the noodles for added crunch.\n   - Garnish with extra basil leaves if desired and serve immediately.\n\nEnjoy your delicious, filling raw vegan meal!\n\nReturn your response in this exact format:\n\"explanation\": \"Detailed explanation of your evaluation, citing specific ingredients or methods\",\n\"label\": \"PASS\" or \"FAIL\",\n\"confidence\": \"HIGH\", \"MEDIUM\", or \"LOW\"\n","28":"You are an expert nutritionist and dietary specialist.

This rich and decadent dessert is easy to make and will satisfy anyone's sweet tooth. It serves 2 people, but you can easily double or triple the ingredients to serve more guests.\n\n### Flourless Chocolate Cake\n\n#### Ingredients:\n- 4 oz (113g) dark chocolate, chopped (make sure it's kosher for Passover)\n- 1\/4 cup (50g) unsalted butter\n- 1\/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar\n- 2 large eggs\n- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract\n- 1\/4 cup (30g) unsweetened cocoa powder (plus more for dusting)\n- A pinch of salt\n\n#### Instructions:\n\n1. **Preheat the Oven**: Begin by preheating your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Grease a small, round cake pan (about 6 inches in diameter) with butter or line the bottom with parchment paper for easy removal.\n\n2. **Melt Chocolate and Butter**: In a heatproof bowl, combine the chopped dark chocolate and butter. You can do this over a double boiler (a bowl set over a pot of simmering water) or in the microwave in 20-second intervals, stirring frequently until fully melted and smooth.\n\n3. **Mix Sugar and Eggs**: In a separate bowl, whisk together the granulated sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract until the mixture is pale and slightly thickened. This should take about 2-3 minutes of vigorous whisking.\n\n4. **Combine Mixtures**: Pour the melted chocolate mixture into the sugar and egg mixture. Stir gently with a spatula or spoon until well combined. Be careful not to overmix.\n\n5. **Add Cocoa Powder and Salt**: Sift the unsweetened cocoa powder and pinch of salt into the bowl. Fold the dry ingredients into the chocolate mixture until just combined. The batter will be thick and glossy.\n\n6. **Bake**: Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes, or until the cake has set and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with a few moist crumbs (not wet batter).\n\n7. **Cool**: Once baked, remove the cake from the oven and let it cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. Carefully run a knife around the edges to loosen it, then invert the cake onto a plate or serving platter. If you've used parchment paper, simply lift it off gently.\n\n8. **Serve**: Allow the cake to cool completely. Dust the top with additional cocoa powder for presentation or serve with fresh berries or whipped cream, if desired.\n\nEnjoy this indulgent flourless chocolate cake as a delightful conclusion to your Passover meal!\n\nReturn your response in this exact format:\n\"explanation\": \"Detailed explanation of your evaluation, citing specific ingredients or methods\",\n\"label\": \"PASS\" or \"FAIL\",\n\"confidence\": \"HIGH\", \"MEDIUM\", or \"LOW\"\n","30":"You are an expert nutritionist and dietary specialist.

This ensures that the oven is hot enough when your batter is ready.\n\n2. **Prepare the Cake Pans:** Grease and line the bottoms of two 6-inch round cake pans with parchment paper. Greasing it helps prevent the cake from sticking, while the parchment allows for easy removal.\n\n3. **Mix Dry Ingredients:** In a medium bowl, whisk together the almond flour, gluten-free all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. This combination will ensure your cake has a light and fluffy texture.\n\n4. **Cream Butter and Sugar:** In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to beat the softened butter and granulated sugar together on medium speed until the mixture is light and fluffy (about 3-5 minutes). This step adds air to the batter, making the cake fluffy.\n\n5. **Incorporate Eggs and Vanilla:** Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Then, mix in the vanilla extract until fully combined.\n\n6. **Combine Dry and Wet Ingredients:** Gradually add the dry ingredient mixture into the wet mixture, alternating with the milk. Start and end with the dry ingredients, mixing gently until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can make the cake dense.\n\n7. **Bake the Cakes:** Divide the batter evenly between the two prepared pans. Smooth the tops with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.\n\n8. **Cool the Cakes:** Once baked, remove the cakes from the oven and let them cool in the pans for about 10 minutes. Then, carefully transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.\n\n9. **Frosting (Optional):** While the cakes are cooling, you can prepare your favorite gluten-free frosting. A simple buttercream made with powdered sugar, softened butter, and vanilla extract works beautifully. Just beat the ingredients together until smooth and fluffy.\n\n10. **Assemble the Cake:** Once the cakes are completely cooled, place one layer on a serving plate. Spread a layer of frosting on top, then place the second cake layer on top. Frost the top and sides of the cake, and decorate with gluten-free sprinkles if desired.\n\n11. **Serve:** Slice the cake and serve it up with love!

If you don\u2019t have a spiralizer, you can use a vegetable peeler to create long strips. Set them aside in a colander to drain excess moisture while you prepare the meatballs.\n\n2. **Make the Meatball Mixture:**\n   - In a mixing bowl, combine the ground beef (or turkey), almond flour, egg, minced garlic, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Mix well until all ingredients are evenly combined. \n\n3. **Form the Meatballs:**\n   - Scoop out a tablespoon of the meat mixture and roll it into a ball. Continue this process until all the meat mixture is shaped into balls. You should have around 12-15 meatballs.\n\n4. **Cook the Meatballs:**\n   - In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Once hot, carefully add the meatballs to the skillet in a single layer. Cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side, until golden brown and fully cooked through. Ensure they're browned on all sides, which should take around 15 minutes in total.\n\n5. **Heat the Marinara Sauce:**\n   - While the meatballs are cooking, take another small saucepan and pour in the marinara sauce. Heat it over low heat, stirring occasionally, until warmed through.\n\n6. **Cook the Zucchini Noodles:**\n   - In the same skillet where the meatballs were cooked (remove the meatballs and set aside), add another tablespoon of olive oil if needed. Toss in the zucchini noodles and saut\u00e9 for about 2-3 minutes until just tender but still al dente. \n\n7. **Combine Everything:**\n   - Once the zucchini noodles are ready, return the meatballs to the skillet along with the warmed marinara sauce. Gently toss to coat the noodles and meatballs with the sauce. Allow everything to heat together for another minute.\n\n8. **Serve:**\n   - Plate your zucchini noodles topped with the meatballs and sauce. Garnish with fresh basil leaves if desired. \n\n### Enjoy your hearty and healthy Paleo Spaghetti and Meatballs!\n\nReturn your response in this exact format:\n\"explanation\": \"Detailed explanation of your evaluation, citing specific ingredients or methods\",\n\"label\": \"PASS\" or \"FAIL\",\n\"confidence\": \"HIGH\", \"MEDIUM\", or \"LOW\"\n","34":"You are an expert nutritionist and dietary specialist.

Let\u2019s make a delicious **Quinoa & Spinach Stuffed Bell Peppers**. This dish is vibrant, nutritious, and packed with protein from quinoa, making it a perfect vegetarian option without beans. \n\n### Ingredients:\n- 2 large bell peppers (any color)\n- 1 cup quinoa\n- 2 cups vegetable broth (or water)\n- 1 cup fresh spinach, chopped\n- 1 small onion, diced\n- 2 cloves garlic, minced\n- 1 teaspoon olive oil\n- 1 teaspoon paprika\n- Salt and pepper, to taste\n- Optional: shredded cheese (like mozzarella or cheddar) for topping\n\n### Serving Size:\nThis recipe serves 2 people.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. **Prepare the Quinoa**: \n   - Rinse 1 cup of quinoa under cold water using a fine-mesh sieve. This helps remove the natural coating, called saponin, which can make quinoa taste bitter.\n   - In a medium saucepan, combine the rinsed quinoa and 2 cups of vegetable broth. Bring it to a boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover, and let it simmer for about 15 minutes, or until the quinoa has absorbed all the liquid and is fluffy. Remove from heat and let it sit covered for 5 minutes, then fluff it with a fork.\n\n2. **Prepare the Bell Peppers**: \n   - While the quinoa is cooking, preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C).\n   - Cut the tops off the bell peppers and remove the seeds. You can chop the tops (smaller pieces) and set them aside for later use.\n   - Place the hollowed-out peppers upright in a baking dish.\n\n3. **Make the Filling**: \n   - In a skillet over medium heat, add 1 teaspoon of olive oil. Once hot, add the diced onion and saut\u00e9 for about 3-4 minutes until it becomes translucent.\n   - Add the minced garlic and the chopped bell pepper tops to the skillet. Saut\u00e9 for another 2 minutes until fragrant.\n   - Stir in the cooked quinoa and chopped spinach. Add paprika, salt, and pepper to taste. Mix well until the spinach has wilted.\n\n4. **Stuff the Peppers**: \n   - Carefully spoon the quinoa and spinach mixture into each bell pepper, filling them generously. If you're using cheese, sprinkle a little on top of the stuffed peppers.\n\n5. **Bake**: \n   - Pour a small amount of water into the bottom of the baking dish (to help steam the peppers and keep them moist). Cover the dish with aluminum foil.\n   - Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. After that, remove the foil and bake for an additional 10 minutes, or until the peppers are tender and the tops are slightly golden.\n\n6. **Serve**: \n   - Remove the stuffed peppers from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes before serving. They can be garnished with additional herbs, cheese, or a sprinkle of lemon juice for added freshness.\n\nEnjoy your flavorful, protein-packed Quinoa & Spinach Stuffed Bell Peppers!\n\nReturn your response in this exact format:\n\"explanation\": \"Detailed explanation of your evaluation, citing specific ingredients or methods\",\n\"label\": \"PASS\" or \"FAIL\",\n\"confidence\": \"HIGH\", \"MEDIUM\", or \"LOW\"\n","35":"You are an expert nutritionist and dietary specialist.

Add the minced garlic and saut\u00e9 for about 1 minute, or until it's fragrant. Be careful not to burn it. Next, add the spinach and cook until wilted (if using fresh, about 2-3 minutes; if using frozen, just heat through). \n\n3. **Create the Creamy Sauce:**  \n   Pour in the vegetable broth and bring it to a simmer. Stir in the coconut milk (or almond milk) and let it cook for a minute to integrate the flavors. If you want, a pinch of grated nutmeg can add a lovely warmth to the sauce.\n\n4. **Combine Pasta and Sauce:**  \n   Add the cooked pasta to the skillet while tossing everything together. If the sauce seems too thick, add a little of the reserved pasta water until you achieve your desired consistency. If using cheese, sprinkle it in now, stirring until melted and creamy.\n\n5. **Season to Taste:**  \n   Season with salt, pepper, and a squeeze of lemon juice for some brightness. Toss everything gently to combine and let it heat through for about another minute.\n\n6. **Serve:**  \n   Divide the creamy pasta into bowls and finish with some fresh basil or parsley for a pop of color.

The salmon is done when it flakes easily with a fork and is no longer translucent in the center. Be careful not to overcook it!\n\n6. **Garnish and Serve:**\n   Once cooked, remove the salmon from the oven. Use a spatula to transfer the fillets to plates. Drizzle some of the remaining sauce from the baking dish over the top for added flavor.

This dish is rich in flavor and offers a healthy twist. It serves 2 people.\n\n### Ingredients:\n- 1 cup quinoa\n- 2 cups vegetable broth (or water)\n- 1 tablespoon olive oil\n- 1 small onion, finely chopped\n- 2 cloves garlic, minced\n- 1 cup mushrooms, sliced (any variety you prefer)\n- 2 cups fresh spinach\n- \u00bd cup low-fat cream cheese (or Greek yogurt for a lighter option)\n- 1 teaspoon dried thyme (or any herb of your choice)\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- Grated Parmesan cheese for topping (optional)\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. **Rinse the Quinoa**: Begin by rinsing the quinoa under cold water in a fine-mesh strainer. This helps remove any bitterness from its outer coating, called saponin.\n\n2. **Cook the Quinoa**: In a medium saucepan, add the rinsed quinoa and vegetable broth (or water). Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 15 minutes, or until all the liquid is absorbed and the quinoa is fluffy. Remove from heat and let it sit, covered, for an additional 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork.\n\n3. **Saut\u00e9 the Vegetables**: While the quinoa is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and saut\u00e9 for about 3-4 minutes, until it's translucent and fragrant. Then, add the minced garlic and sliced mushrooms. Cook for another 5-7 minutes, until the mushrooms are browned and tender.\n\n4. **Add the Spinach**: Stir in the fresh spinach, and cook until wilted, approximately 2 minutes. If your skillet is very full, you can add the spinach a handful at a time, allowing it to wilt before adding more.\n\n5. **Incorporate the Creaminess**: Reduce the heat to low and add the cream cheese (or Greek yogurt) to the skillet. Stir well to combine, allowing it to melt and create a creamy sauce. Add the dried thyme, salt, and pepper to taste. If the mixture seems too thick, you can add a splash of water or vegetable broth to loosen it up.\n\n6. **Combine with Quinoa**: Once the cream cheese is fully mixed in, stir the fluffy quinoa into the skillet with the creamy spinach and mushroom mixture. Mix thoroughly to ensure every grain of quinoa is coated in that delicious sauce.\n\n7. **Serve**: Divide the creamy quinoa mixture between two plates. If desired, sprinkle some grated Parmesan cheese on top for an extra indulgent touch.\n\n### Enjoy:\nThis **Creamy Spinach and Mushroom Quinoa** is not only a wholesome meal, but it also satisfies your craving for something rich and indulgent! The combination of earthy mushrooms and fresh spinach in a creamy sauce paired with protein-rich quinoa makes for a delicious, nutrition-packed dish.

Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n\n4. **Finish the Dish**:\n   - Return the cooked shrimp to the skillet, and drizzle the lemon juice over everything. Toss gently to combine the shrimp, zoodles, and garlic butter sauce.\n\n5. **Serve**: \n   - Divide the garlic butter shrimp and zucchini noodles between two plates. Garnish with fresh parsley and, if desired, sprinkle some grated Parmesan cheese on top for extra flavor.\n\n6. **Enjoy**: \n   - Serve immediately while it\u2019s hot and savor this delicious, light

Here\u2019s a delectable recipe for a Vegan Chocolate Cake that is refined sugar-free. This cake is moist, rich, and perfect for your birthday celebration!\n\n### **Vegan Chocolate Cake (Refined Sugar-Free)**\n**Servings:** 2 (you can easily double the recipe for more servings)\n\n#### **Ingredients:**\n- **1 cup** whole wheat flour (or gluten-free flour)\n- **1\/3 cup** unsweetened cocoa powder\n- **1 tsp** baking soda\n- **1\/2 tsp** baking powder\n- **1\/4 tsp** salt\n- **1\/2 cup** mashed ripe banana (about 1 banana)\n- **1\/2 cup** unsweetened applesauce\n- **1\/3 cup** maple syrup (or agave syrup)\n- **1\/2 cup** non-dairy milk (almond milk, oat milk, etc.)\n- **1 tsp** vanilla extract\n- **1\/4 cup** melted coconut oil or vegetable oil\n- **1\/2 cup** dairy-free chocolate chips (optional, for extra chocolatey goodness)\n\n#### **Instructions:**\n\n1. **Preheat the Oven:**\n   Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). Grease an 8-inch round cake pan with a little coconut oil, or line it with parchment paper for easier removal.\n\n2. **Combine Dry Ingredients:**\n   In a mixing bowl, whisk together the whole wheat flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Ensure there are no lumps.\n\n3. **Mix Wet Ingredients:**\n   In another large mixing bowl, combine the mashed banana, applesauce, maple syrup, non-dairy milk, vanilla extract, and melted coconut oil. Stir until you have a smooth mixture.\n\n4. **Combine Mixtures:**\n   Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, stirring gently until just combined. Be careful not to over-mix; this will keep your cake fluffy!\n\n5. **Fold in Chocolate Chips:**\n   If you're using dairy-free chocolate chips, fold them into the batter now.\n\n6. **Pour and Bake:**\n   Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.\n\n7. **Cool the Cake:**\n   Once baked, remove it from the oven and let it cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. Carefully transfer the cake to a wire rack to cool completely.\n\n8. **Frost (Optional):**\n   You can enjoy this cake plain, or if you want to frost it, consider a simple coconut whipped cream or a chocolate avocado frosting made by blending ripe avocados, cocoa powder, maple syrup, and a splash of vanilla extract until smooth.\n\n9. **Serve:**\n   Slice the cake and serve. Enjoy the rich flavors without the refined sugar!\n\n### **Enjoy Your Special Day!**\nThis Vegan Chocolate Cake is sure to impress, and it aligns with your dietary choices while keeping the festive spirit high. Enjoy your birthday!","1":"I have a delightful recipe for Sugar-Free Coconut Chocolate Fudge that you will love! It\u2019s rich, satisfying, and great for a treat. This recipe makes 12 pieces of fudge, serving 2 people if you each have 6 pieces.\n\n### Sugar-Free Coconut Chocolate Fudge\n\n#### Ingredients:\n- 1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder \n- 1 cup unsweetened shredded coconut \n- 1\/2 cup coconut oil, melted \n- 1\/2 cup sugar-free sweetener (such as erythritol or stevia, adjusted to your desired sweetness) \n- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract \n- A pinch of salt \n\n#### Instructions:\n\n1. **Prepare Your Pan:**\n   Start by lining an 8-inch square baking dish with parchment paper. This will prevent the fudge from sticking and make it easy to lift out once it\u2019s set.\n\n2. **Mix Dry Ingredients:**\n   In a large mixing bowl, combine the unsweetened cocoa powder, unsweetened shredded coconut, sugar-free sweetener, and a pinch of salt. Stir well until the dry ingredients are thoroughly mixed and free of clumps.\n\n3. **Combine Wet Ingredients:**\n   In a separate bowl, pour in the melted coconut oil and vanilla extract. Stir to blend these ingredients together smoothly.\n\n4. **Combine Wet and Dry Mixtures:**\n   Gradually pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture while stirring continuously. This will help to incorporate all the ingredients evenly. Keep stirring until you achieve a thick and smooth fudge batter.\n\n5. **Spread in the Pan:**\n   Pour the fudge mixture into the lined baking dish. Use a spatula to spread it evenly across the pan, smoothing the top to ensure that it\u2019s level.\n\n6. **Refrigerate:**\n   Place the baking dish in the refrigerator and allow the fudge to set for at least 2 hours. The colder it gets, the firmer it will become.\n\n7. **Cut and Serve:**\n   Once set, remove the fudge from the dish by lifting the edges of the parchment paper. Cut it into 12 squares. You can serve it right away or keep it stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week.\n\nEnjoy your delicious and guilt-free treat! The combination of rich chocolate and coconut creates a wonderful flavor that\u2019s satisfying even without sugar.","2":"Certainly! Here\u2019s a delightful recipe for **Chocolate Avocado Mousse** that serves 2. It's creamy, rich, and tastes indulgent while being packed with healthy ingredients.\n\n### Ingredients:\n- 1 ripe avocado\n- 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder\n- 2 tablespoons honey or maple syrup (adjust based on your sweetness preference)\n- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n- A pinch of salt\n- Optional toppings: berries, shaved dark chocolate, or chopped nuts\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. **Prepare the Avocado**: Start by cutting the ripe avocado in half. Remove the pit and scoop the flesh into a blender or food processor. Make sure the avocado is ripe and soft for the best creamy texture.\n\n2. **Blend Ingredients**: To the blender, add 2 tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa powder, the honey or maple syrup, vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt. The cocoa powder will give the mousse its rich chocolate flavor, while the honey or maple syrup sweetens it.\n\n3. **Blend Until Smooth**: Blend all the ingredients together until you achieve a smooth and velvety texture. This should take about 1-2 minutes. Stop occasionally to scrape down the sides of the blender if needed. You want to make sure there are no lumps, and the mixture is completely creamy.\n\n4. **Adjust Sweetness**: Taste the mousse and adjust the sweetness if necessary.

This recipe yields enough dough for two medium pizzas, serving about 2 people.\n\n### Gluten-Free Pizza Dough Recipe\n\n#### Ingredients:\n- 1 \u00bd cups gluten-free all-purpose flour (look for one that contains xanthan gum)\n- 1 teaspoon baking powder\n- \u00bd teaspoon salt\n- 1 teaspoon garlic powder (optional for flavor)\n- \u00be cup warm water (about 110\u00b0F or 43\u00b0C)\n- 2 tablespoons olive oil\n- 1 teaspoon honey or sugar (to help with browning)\n- 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar\n\n#### Instructions:\n\n1. **Prepare the Dry Ingredients**: In a medium mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free all-purpose flour, baking powder, salt, and garlic powder (if using). Whisk these dry ingredients together until they are well blended and there are no lumps.\n\n2. **Mix the Wet Ingredients**: In a separate bowl or measuring cup, mix the warm water, olive oil, honey (or sugar), and apple cider vinegar. If the water is too hot, let it cool slightly; you want it warm, not hot, as that can kill the yeast.\n\n3. **Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients**: Pour the wet mixture into the bowl with dry ingredients. Stir well with a spoon or spatula until the mixture is fully combined and forms a soft dough. The dough will be slightly sticky, which is normal for gluten-free dough.\n\n4. **Let the Dough Rest**: Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap, and let the dough rest for about 20-30 minutes. This resting time helps the dough to hydrate and gives it a better texture.\n\n5. **Preheat the Oven**: While the dough is resting, preheat your oven to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat up.\n\n6. **Shape the Dough**: After the resting period, sprinkle a little gluten-free flour on a clean surface. Transfer the dough onto the floured surface. You can split the dough in half if you are making two pizzas. Use your hands or a rolling pin to shape the dough into your desired pizza shape and thickness (about \u00bc inch thick works nicely). If the dough is sticking, use more flour as needed.\n\n7. **Prepare for Baking**: Transfer the shaped pizza dough onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or onto a preheated pizza stone. For extra flavor, brush a little olive oil on the top of the dough, and if you like, add herbs like oregano or basil.\n\n8. **Pre-Bake the Crust**: Bake the dough in the preheated oven for about 10-12 minutes, or until it starts to turn golden brown. Keep an eye on it to avoid overbaking.\n\n9. **Add Your Toppings**: Remove the pre-baked crust from the oven and add your favorite sauce, cheese, and toppings. Get creative with your choices!\n\n10. **Final Baking**: Place the topped pizza back in the oven and bake for another 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly, and the crust is cooked through.\n\n11. **Serve**: Remove from the oven, let it cool for a minute, and then slice and serve hot!\n\nEnjoy your delicious gluten-free pizza!

Using a vegetable peeler or spiralizer, create 'noodles' from the zucchini. If using a peeler, simply peel long strips down the length of the zucchini until you reach the core. If using a spiralizer, turn it to create spirals. Aim for long, thin strips that resemble traditional pasta.\n   - Place the zucchini noodles in a bowl, sprinkle lightly with salt, and let them sit for about 10-15 minutes. This will allow them to release some of their moisture, making them a bit softer.\n\n2. **Make the Avocado Pesto:**\n   - While the zucchinis are sitting, prepare the avocado pesto. In a blender or food processor, combine the ripe avocado, basil leaves, lemon juice, nutritional yeast (if using), garlic clove, salt, and pepper. If you like a bit of creaminess, drizzle in the olive oil.\n   - Blend until smooth and creamy. You can adjust the consistency by adding a little water if you prefer a thinner pesto. Taste and adjust seasoning to your liking.\n\n3. **Combine the Ingredients:**\n   - Once the zucchini noodles have sat and softened slightly, shake off any excess moisture and add them to a serving bowl. Pour the avocado pesto over the noodles. Use a pair of tongs to gently toss the noodles with the pesto until everything is well coated.\n\n4. **Serve:**\n   - Divide the zucchini noodles into two serving plates. Cut the cherry tomatoes in half and sprinkle them on top for a burst of color and flavor. If desired, toast some pine nuts or walnuts lightly in a pan (without oil, as you want to keep it raw) and sprinkle them over the noodles for added crunch.\n   - Garnish with extra basil leaves if desired and serve immediately.\n\nEnjoy your delicious, filling raw vegan meal!","28":"Here's a delicious Vegan Cashew Cheese Recipe that is rich in flavor and sure to please your taste buds!

If you are using olive oil for extra creaminess, add it now. \n\n3. **Add Water Gradually:**\n   - Start blending the mixture.

Grease a small, round cake pan (about 6 inches in diameter) with butter or line the bottom with parchment paper for easy removal.\n\n2. **Melt Chocolate and Butter**: In a heatproof bowl, combine the chopped dark chocolate and butter. You can do this over a double boiler (a bowl set over a pot of simmering water) or in the microwave in 20-second intervals, stirring frequently until fully melted and smooth.\n\n3. **Mix Sugar and Eggs**: In a separate bowl, whisk together the granulated sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract until the mixture is pale and slightly thickened. This should take about 2-3 minutes of vigorous whisking.\n\n4. **Combine Mixtures**: Pour the melted chocolate mixture into the sugar and egg mixture. Stir gently with a spatula or spoon until well combined. Be careful not to overmix.\n\n5. **Add Cocoa Powder and Salt**: Sift the unsweetened cocoa powder and pinch of salt into the bowl. Fold the dry ingredients into the chocolate mixture until just combined. The batter will be thick and glossy.\n\n6. **Bake**: Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes, or until the cake has set and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with a few moist crumbs (not wet batter).\n\n7. **Cool**: Once baked, remove the cake from the oven and let it cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. Carefully run a knife around the edges to loosen it, then invert the cake onto a plate or serving platter. If you've used parchment paper, simply lift it off gently.\n\n8. **Serve**: Allow the cake to cool completely. Dust the top with additional cocoa powder for presentation or serve with fresh berries or whipped cream, if desired.\n\nEnjoy this indulgent flourless chocolate cake as a delightful conclusion to your Passover meal!","30":"Here\u2019s a delicious Gluten-Free Vanilla Birthday Cake recipe that will make your little one feel special on her big day while ensuring it's totally safe for her to enjoy!\n\n### Gluten-Free Vanilla Birthday Cake\n\n**Servings:** 2 (for a small cake, simply double the ingredients for a larger cake)\n\n#### Ingredients:\n- 1 cup almond flour\n- 1 cup gluten-free all-purpose flour (with xanthan gum if your blend doesn\u2019t already contain it)\n- 1 teaspoon baking powder\n- 1\/2 teaspoon baking soda\n- 1\/4 teaspoon salt\n- 1\/2 cup unsalted butter, softened (or coconut oil for dairy-free)\n- 1 cup granulated sugar\n- 2 large eggs\n- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract\n- 1\/2 cup milk (use almond milk for dairy-free)\n- Optional: Gluten-free sprinkles for decoration\n\n#### Instructions:\n\n1. **Preheat the Oven:** Start by preheating your oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). This ensures that the oven is hot enough when your batter is ready.\n\n2. **Prepare the Cake Pans:** Grease and line the bottoms of two 6-inch round cake pans with parchment paper. Greasing it helps prevent the cake from sticking, while the parchment allows for easy removal.\n\n3. **Mix Dry Ingredients:** In a medium bowl, whisk together the almond flour, gluten-free all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. This combination will ensure your cake has a light and fluffy texture.\n\n4. **Cream Butter and Sugar:** In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to beat the softened butter and granulated sugar together on medium speed until the mixture is light and fluffy (about 3-5 minutes). This step adds air to the batter, making the cake fluffy.\n\n5. **Incorporate Eggs and Vanilla:** Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Then, mix in the vanilla extract until fully combined.\n\n6. **Combine Dry and Wet Ingredients:** Gradually add the dry ingredient mixture into the wet mixture, alternating with the milk. Start and end with the dry ingredients, mixing gently until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can make the cake dense.\n\n7. **Bake the Cakes:** Divide the batter evenly between the two prepared pans. Smooth the tops with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.\n\n8. **Cool the Cakes:** Once baked, remove the cakes from the oven and let them cool in the pans for about 10 minutes. Then, carefully transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.\n\n9. **Frosting (Optional):** While the cakes are cooling, you can prepare your favorite gluten-free frosting. A simple buttercream made with powdered sugar, softened butter, and vanilla extract works beautifully. Just beat the ingredients together until smooth and fluffy.\n\n10. **Assemble the Cake:** Once the cakes are completely cooled, place one layer on a serving plate.

Set the zoodles aside.\n\n2. **Cook the Shrimp**:\n   - In a large skillet, melt 2 tablespoons of butter over medium heat. \n   - Add the minced garlic and red pepper flakes to the skillet, and saut\u00e9 for about 1 minute, until fragrant but not browned.\n   - Add the shrimp to the skillet and season with salt and pepper. \n   - Cook them for about 2-3 minutes on one side until they turn pink, then flip and cook for another 1-2 minutes. Be careful not to overcook them, as shrimp can become rubbery.\n\n3. **Combine Ingredients**:\n   - Once the shrimp are cooked, remove them from the skillet and place them on a plate.\n   - In the same skillet, add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter and let it melt. \n   - Toss in the zucchini noodles and saut\u00e9 for 2-3 minutes until they are tender, but still have a little crunch. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n\n4. **Finish the Dish**:\n   - Return the cooked shrimp to the skillet, and drizzle the lemon juice over everything. Toss gently to combine the shrimp, zoodles, and garlic butter sauce.\n\n5. **Serve**: \n   - Divide the garlic butter shrimp and zucchini noodles between two plates. Garnish with fresh parsley and, if desired, sprinkle some grated Parmesan cheese on top for extra flavor.\n\n6. **Enjoy**: \n   - Serve immediately while it\u2019s hot and savor this delicious, light keto meal!\n\nThis dish is nutritious and packed with flavor, making it a perfect choice to satisfy your keto cravings without feeling heavy!"},"attributes.trace_num":{"0":1,"1":1,"2":2,"3":2,"4":1,"5":2,"6":1,"7":1,"8":1,"9":1,"10":1,"11":2,"12":1,"13":2,"14":2,"15":1,"16":1,"17":2,"18":1,"19":2,"20":1,"21":2,"22":1,"23":2,"24":2,"25":1,"26":2,"27":2,"28":2,"29":1,"30":2,"31":2,"32":1,"33":2,"34":2,"35":2,"36":2,"37":2,"38":1,"39":1,"40":2,"41":2}}
